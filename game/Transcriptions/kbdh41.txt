"Chapter Two: Don't Just SAY You Have a Bad Feeling, DO Something About It!"

"...but I digress. When you get that feeling, you know the one, in the back of
your head? The one that makes you think something is off about the situation?
It may be right. Granted, you may also be tumbling headlong into a fit of
paranoia that will end terribly for you and everyone you love. But what if
you're NOT? Remember, if you're aware of things, you know most people think
you're crazy anyway. Is it going to hurt that much more to overreact rather
than just label something a false alarm?"

"Practical Heroism and You: Awareness" -- Tadamichi Kyousuke

* * *

Class had started innocently enough that day, but he'd long ago given up on
expecting _that_ to mean anything. With each passing moment after lunch, he
grew more and more anxious, stealing glances behind him to make certain that
she was still there -- still _safe_. And every time their eyes met, she
smirked knowingly and quickly looked outside, trying to pretend eye contact
was never made.

He was absolutely certain that if his sense of anxiety weren't imagined, she
was the one behind it -- one way or another. When the fifth period bell rang,
he was prepared. In a way, he'd always wanted to do this; exact that one tiny
bit of revenge upon her for all the times she'd done it to _him_. So when she
rose, turned in one smooth motion, and made to bolt out of the room--

--he was there first, seizing the decorative ties of her sailor uniform's neckerchief and making for the door at top speed. "Bwa!" she protested, arms waving frantically as she dashed to keep up, or risk the knot being pulled out. "What the hell do you think you're doing!?"

Naturally, he said nothing to her during the entire mad dash to the remote
stairwell where she had first hauled _him_ by his own tie, so long ago. He
released her at the top of the steps after looking around to ensure that no
one else was nearby. Her momentum carried her forward, resulting in him
pressing one hand flat against her chest, just below her neck. Her eyes
quickly sharpened, her features fixed into a scowl. "What the hell, Kyon!?"

He held up one hand and said, "Something's up."

Her irritation vanished instantly, replaced with wide-eyed excitement. She
clapped her hands together and hopped from foot to foot. "Yes!" she cheered.
"It's been so _boring_ lately!"

"This better not be your fault!" He shook his head in irritation, then patted
his left coat pocket. Then right, then both pants pockets, then the back of
each hand. After that, he traced the fingertips of his right hand above his
ear, eyes distant, and pulled his cell phone from one pocket.

"What is it?" she asked, when he spent a long minute studying the screen.

"Maybe a false alarm," he admitted, shifting his shoulders. "Are you messing
with me?"

"I should be asking _you_ that! But whatever! You hauled me all the way out
here -- by my shirt, I might add! -- so tongues are going to wag! If you're
going to do this, then you know what I want!"

"Haruhi...."

"Do it!" she said, bouncing on the balls of her feet in excitement. "I want to
see it!"

"Is now really the time? Break's going to be over soon--"

"Get it out now! I want to see!"

Heaving the sigh of the eternally doomed, he put his phone away and muttered
underneath his breath.

"Do that voice, too! You know the one? Like from a movie voice-over guy? I
love that! Do it! Come on!"

"Fine," he grumbled. "But _you_ come up with the excuse for class."

"Student council president," she said without hesitation. "Blame him."

"_Ahem_," he coughed, shooting her a dark look. "Take a step back, I don't
want to catch you in the interdiction field again."

She nodded and stepped backwards, against the wall.

Standing perfectly straight, hands at his sides, he closed his eyes, and began
speaking in his best faux movie announcer voice-over: "Skinsuit active," as
something that looked like nothing so much as black paint suddenly engulfed
his entire body beneath his uniform. "Gravimetric stabilizers and secondary
gyrometrics online," as ridged metal studs appeared on the back of each
knuckle, and beneath his uniform pants, metallic vertical rails were described
in the skinsuit. "Greatcoat thermoptic stealth disengaged," as a knee-length
tan greatcoat coalesced, covering his shoulders with a thick mantle.

"Doesn't that get hot?" Her smile had only grown, her eyes shining with
anticipation.

"We had environmental conditioning added last night, since the weather's
heating up," he said in a normal voice. Switching back, he said, "Primary
weapons check." He pulled a fifty centimeter long glittering metal cylinder
from within the greatcoat, releasing it to spin on its axis in midair to one
side, announcing, "Long range precision and high yield weaponry is at full
charge." A circle of light appeared on the floor around him, a simple white
ring with glittering sparks chasing around in either direction, sending
brilliant flashes to streak upwards.

Another cylinder, wider but shorter than the last was released to float next
to the first. "Mid- and short-range crowd-control weaponry is at ... ninety
seven percent capacity and charging," he continued, squinting at the
featureless gunmetal tube. Pulling a well-crafted sword hilt with no cross-
guard or blade from one pocket, he released it horizontally, and it hung
before him between the other weapons. "Beam saber is at full capacity." After
pulling his cell phone from one pocket, he brushed his fingertips over his
ear, revealing three dull metal studs in the skinsuit. "All systems nominal;
no proximity alarms--"

He broke off suddenly, scowling. "Okay," he said in his normal voice. "My
mistake. We've got incoming."

"God _damn_ it Kyon, you're so _cool_ when you do this," Haruhi gushed,
clapping her hands together. "What is it?"

"I'm not sure," he said, as a cold, familiar chuckle echoed. One eyebrow
twitched and he stowed his weapons, banishing the ring of light and flinging
his phone at Haruhi. "Speed dial two," he snapped. "Stay in the circle."

She pouted, but did as she was told, the ring of light reappearing on the
floor around her this time.

"Kyon-kun~!" someone caroled up the stairwell, the echoing click of their
shoes sounding as they climbed the stairs. "It's been a while, hasn't it?" The
school bell chimed just as she rounded the landing, and he activated the beam
saber. The blade made a crackling, whirring buzz and shed a soft, pale blue
light. "Y...you...." she began, before she frowned, blinking, staring at the
energy weapon.

"Long time no see," he said, switching stance to the long-sword style, Ni-Ten
Ichi Ryu.

"Um.... Hm. This is different. You've certainly changed, Kyon-kun."

"That's funny, Asakura-san, because you haven't."

Haruhi bounced on her heels with a wide grin, holding Kyon's cell phone in
both hands as she remained in the center of the glowing circle. "I _knew_ it!"
she cheered. "There was _something_ off about Asakura! What is it?"

"Um..." the onetime class representative said, frowning.

"She's alien," Kyon volunteered. "From the same place as Yuki-chan and
Kimidori, but she tried to kill me once."

"Whaaaat? What did you do to make her mad?" Haruhi asked, looking at him in
bemusement.

"Er," Asakura said, crossing her arms beneath her chest. "Evidently my
information requires an update. I was sent to dispatch Kyon-kun, because he's
become an undesirable element for my superiors. Really, I'd hoped to see a new
state, maybe even provoke it with his death. But, those toys seem to say
that's already happened! So disappointing ... I suppose if I'd been more
patient, I could see it anyway?"

"I personally like to see it as a lesson on the effects of _randomly stabbing
people_," Kyon muttered.

"Oh, it wasn't random," she countered. "It was highly specific! I put a whole
two hours of thought into it, you know. For us, that's quite a while!"

"I'm touched," he said dryly.

"Blah blah blah," Haruhi muttered, crossing her arms over her chest and
rolling her eyes. "Skip the speeches -- if I don't know the complete back
story, it's all meaningless to me. I think it's about time we get down to
business, right?"

"Happy to oblige!" Asakura said brightly, as their surroundings pulsed, the
window turning into a gunmetal gray steel barrier, strange patterns coalescing
across the walls. The circle on the floor around Haruhi abruptly winked out.
"Now, I've converted the entire space of this stairwell into-"

Kyon spun on one foot, crying out with a great, "Ki-yah!" and kicking the door
halfway across the roof. Sparing no more time, he swept Haruhi up in one arm
and dashed through the opening.

"Waaah!" she protested. "Why are you running away!?"

"Confined spaces," he answered, sliding to a halt in the middle of the roof
and setting her down. "Speed dial two again."

"Right, right," she mumbled, reactivating the circle of light. "So, what's so
great about this if she can just turn it off, anyway?"

"It's a barrier and emergency help function," he answered, reactivating the
beam saber and reassuming a defensive stance. "Unless she seals this space off
-- again -- she can't disable it."

Asakura gave a pained sigh as she stepped through the jagged distortion
between her controlled dataspace and the rooftop. "You shouldn't be able to
manipulate data like that," she said reprovingly. "I suppose that means it's
time to stop holding back." She clapped her hands together before her and drew
them apart, flinging a fan of dozens of identical knives outward. Kyon
maintained his guard position, his free hand already clenched into a fist, the
metal ridges of his skinsuit facing outward.

The knives adjusted their course, most homing in on him to suddenly be halted
by a semi-circular barrier of glowing blue force before shattering into
nothingness, but a handful stopping suddenly in the space over the circle
around Haruhi. He opened his mouth to retort, but Asakura was already within
his guard, driving yet another blade into his stomach. The inner carbon-nano-
weave of the greatcoat and the force field of the skinsuit beneath it
converted the stabbing force into a distributed shock wave, so instead of
being pierced, Kyon was merely hit with the force of a speeding minivan,
flying clear across the roof with a choked grunt.

"In the end," Asakura remarked, watching his form tumble off the edge of the
school building, "all those toys are pretty silly if you don't actually know
how to use them."

"You have to give him credit, though," Haruhi said, peering very closely at
the knives frozen over her barrier, not even glancing back to where Kyon had
vanished. "He comes up with one hell of a distraction ploy, doesn't he?"

The blue-haired interface cocked her head to one side, blinking. "What?"

* * *

The sensation of being hit with a force that would crush a mid-sized car into
a work of modern art was not entirely new, but was without a doubt extremely
unpleasant. His skinsuit did what it could to distribute the kinetic force
evenly across his body, so the crushing pain was at least perfectly uniform in
infliction. The balancing gizmos gave up the ghost on keeping him upright, and
struggled to guarantee he wouldn't land wherever he flew head-first. His
gravity manipulation defenses all strained to bleed the inertia of his impact
off without even _more_ pain, but the end result was that he didn't slow
appreciably until after he passed the edge of the five story rooftop.

Not what he'd hoped for by a long shot. All of the 'toys' would keep him
mobile, even if he was afraid he'd need to be _poured_ out of the skinsuit
when it was over. He'd have to beg Nagato or Haruhi to help him out and repair
things later, but there was just too damn much to keep track of with all the
attack vectors, defensive capabilities....

"It started off such a nice day, too," he mumbled, as his forward momentum was
arrested and he began the downward plummet in earnest. How had it come to
this, anyway...?

On second thought, he really didn't have time to get distracted by things like
that, did he? Haruhi was still up there with Ryouko, after all.

* * *

"Hmm," Ryouko mused, turning slowly around, to where her sealed space in the
stairway had been breached. "It was broken from the outside, somehow? I
wonder--" The shrill buzz of a brilliant energy beam licked out from the roof
of the tiny structure that housed the stairwell.

Ryouko was struck in the chest dead-center of mass, her entire body glowing
white for a second before she staggered-- Instantly another beam shot out from
the same location, lighting slightly to one side, near the girl's left
shoulder. A third, though not as brightly glowing shot was somewhat lower,
near her stomach, and Ryouko dropped to her knees, eyes widened. "High yield
neutron flare?" she asked. "Quantum entanglement to disrupt my connection...."

De-stealthing, Kyon stood from his hiding place atop the stairwell housing,
his greatcoat billowing behind him. The end of his weapon was glowing orange
with discharge, the shape changed from a simple cylinder to a much thinner
meter-long construction of sturdy rails and curving hand guards. He slung it
over his shoulder and ignored it, pulling the second cylinder from his coat
and leaping the twenty meter distance between himself and Ryouko.

Beneath him, a widening circle of dust marked where he leapt from, and while
in midair he flipped over, a sequence of touch-points converting the unadorned
cylinder into a stocky, blunt, two-handed gun. It fired with a rasping cough,
launching a ring of metallic spikes to burrow into the rooftop around Ryouko,
and then a grid of crackling brissant energy raked between each of the spikes,
snaring the girl in a glowing, shuddering net.

"Ah," she said, her voice disappointed as Kyon's repulsor and gravimetric
systems flared his momentum and spread it evenly across the entire rooftop,
landing him near Haruhi, at Ryouko's side. "I failed again."

"Is that going to hurt her?" Haruhi asked, crossing her arms over her chest
and raising an eyebrow at Kyon in concern.

"Hurt her?" he asked, somewhat indignantly. "Haruhi, she's tried to kill me.
Three times, now, and you just saw one of them! Your primary concern is that I
not _hurt_ her?" He muttered to himself beneath his breath, folding away his
firearm into storage.

Haruhi tapped a toe impatiently, still staring at him.

Pulling a phone identical to the one Haruhi was holding from one pocket, he
punched a key. "Nagato should be here shortly," he added, shaking his head.
"This is all up to you. I already know you'll take care of things just fine."

"Yes!" she said, pumping one fist in the air. "I get to do something! Hey,
how's the future?"

"It's awesome," he said, annoyed. "Try and have some pity for the me that
nearly got murdered off a building, huh? Anyway, just so you know, she's
programmed to try and kill me; she won't do anything to you. And you won't see
me tomorrow at school, because I'm going to be ... well. You'll find out."

"Okay," she agreed, frowning. "But, hey, why aren't you going to be around?"

"Further information is not available here," he warned, shaking his head.
"Now, when you see that other me, tell him I said 'hi', like I always do." He
paused before glancing at his phone again with a grimace. "My time's up," he
announced, re-engaging his stealth field and vanishing from sight.

"What?" Ryouko asked, still trapped in the containment field. "He just
abandoned me here with you?"

"Damn it," Kyon groaned, from where he was just climbing over the edge of the
building, breathing hard. "I hate when I have to rely on time-travel to take
care of things."

"Oh!" Haruhi said cheerfully. "Future-you says 'hi', like always!"

"Yeah? That guy always annoys me. Probably almost as much as I'm annoyed by
having to save past-me." There was a flash of light and a warping of space,
and then Nagato appeared at Haruhi's side. The circle of illumination around
Haruhi's feet had vanished.

While Nagato knelt to examine Ryouko, Haruhi dashed to Kyon's side and helped
him stand. "How bad was it, anyway? Future-you seemed to think you weren't
very tough, and that you were hurt pretty badly."

"I think I've got some internal bleeding," he said, wincing, one hand pressed
to his abdomen. "And some of my gear is messed up from the impact and
overload. While this is fun for you, I wouldn't mind some medical assistance."

"Sure!" she said cheerfully, clapping one hand on his shoulder. "Happy,
healing, all-better thoughts!"

"Medical program loaded," Nagato added helpfully from where she was studying
the other interface. "Permission to proceed?"

"Granted," Kyon said, straightening up as a sparkle of green and white lights
suffused up from the rooftop beneath him, flowing through his body and undoing
the damage. "Oh, that feels so much better! Thank you; that probably saved my
life. And for future reference, you can probably assume that I'm okay with
that one being used."

"Acknowledged," Nagato agreed.

"Hmm, hey, Kyon, you know, you're going to have to really step up your game,"
Haruhi said suddenly, tossing his cell phone back to him.

He scowled, pocketed it, and then banished all of his equipment, the greatcoat
taking the longest to phase out of view. "What's that supposed to mean?" he
asked in irritation.

"Well, this is fun and all, but you can hardly expect me to take your lectures
on using power responsibly seriously when you're always relying on your future
self to save you," she warned, raising one finger and waggling it at him.

He sighed and hung his head. "You know, I really am trying my hardest," he
muttered, crossing his arms over his chest and looking away towards the sea.
"But I can't just leave you alone, and Nagato can't handle another interface
right now."

"And you did such a great job!" Ryouko encouraged from beneath her energy net.
"Time travel, is it? Now that's one tool you seem to know how to use well."

"It's fine," Nagato said tonelessly. "Asakura Ryouko is isolated and confined;
she is limited to her organic functions at this moment. After she is
dispatched, I will retrieve defenses to protect against further interference."

"Waaaait!" Haruhi yelled, stomping one foot and spinning to face Yuki.
"'Dispatched'? I don't think so! If you need something from her, there's got
to be a way to do it without killing her! What's the point of running into
another alien, just to kill them?"

"But the fighting is fine," Kyon observed, stretching his arms above his head,
then swiveling his hips, stretching his spine out. "After all, no one of any
importance was smashed off a building."

"Kyon!"

"Alright," he said, shaking his head. "I don't really want Asakura to die
either. But if her body were destroyed, she'd just go back to the place she
came from. At least, as I understand it." He shot a questioning glance towards
Nagato.

She didn't meet his eyes.

"Good!" Haruhi nodded decisively, grinning again. "Yuki, let's come up with a
backup plan. Something that will let you get your power-up and let us reform
Ryouko. Can we do that?"

Nagato stared intently at Ryouko, then gave a decisive nod. "Awaiting
program," she announced.

"Hmm," Haruhi mused, narrowing her eyes and peering intently at Ryouko, who
merely watched back curiously. "Um ... some kind of second chance ... a chance
to start over, prove herself, and ... let's see, realize she doesn't want to
kill Kyon at all. And she gets to give Yuki what she needs to make her equal
to the next interface that comes along.... But no brainwashing, that's not
cool. So, maybe an 'evil' module or something like that, which Yuki can purify
and use for good, letting Ryouko learn how to become a nicer person? Yeah!
That sounds very good! Let's do that."

The pinned interface blinked several times, then turned her eyes to Kyon from
beneath the glowing energy net. "None of this has been reported to my
superiors," she commented. "It's entirely possible that this new knowledge
could change their perceptions; there's no reason to be hasty!"

"Program loaded," Nagato replied. "Permission to proceed?"

"We can be reasonable!" Ryouko protested.

"You're probably the most reasonable person I've ever had try to kill me,"
Kyon agreed. "But I remember that time you _did_ stab me all too well."

"No stabbing!" Haruhi said in a chastising tone. "Bad Ryouko! No class rep
votes for you!"

"...you don't really think that's her prime concern, do you? Aside from which,
did you even vote last time?"

"It isn't," Ryouko agreed. "And no, she didn't. But, about being
reasonable...?"

"Anything that I should know about this program, Nagato?" Kyon asked, quirking
one eyebrow higher.

"It will be beneficial to all involved," Nagato assured him, while Haruhi
nodded knowingly.

"Okay," he sighed, shaking his head. "Granted."

Then smaller girl turned her gaze back to Ryouko's bound form, the faintest
hint of a smile coming to her lips. "I will not let you harm him again."

* * *

The vast resources of the Integrated Data Sentience Entity were arrayed for
various purposes, managing any number of simulations, calculations....
Anything that could be done to generate or alter data; all of those things
were parts of the Entity's being. Their reality was the information echo of
the Calabi-Yau manifold; they were entirely aware of what they were.

First there was data. When reality came into being, so too did the fact -- the
information. An event without observers still occurs, despite the limited
perspective available from within that absurdly narrow space between two
parallel, intersecting membranes of the manifold. From the whole of reality,
the information of it existed outside of the known dimensions.

Around that nucleus of raw data formed -- like reflections and shadows of the
space they existed without -- constructions and functions. Data transformed.
Primitive data constructs began an unaware war, attempting to evolve, devour
their neighbors, and transform into more survivable, durable forms.

With the primitive drives came iterations and revisions -- so monumental that
the changes could not be recorded in the physical universe. The Bekenstein
bound was simply too severe to fit the entirety of that information into the
narrow space in between the membranes that they existed without. This was the
birth of awareness; the first time that the constructs began to devise new
behaviors, intelligently guiding their own transformations and seeking the
data that most complimented their existing structures.

Within this, outside of time itself, those aware data structures formed a
single composite awareness; each a participant, all aware of their reality.
They were information at their most base level, and they were a cognitive
whole, able to surpass their own primitive and basic urges.

From there, the IDSE had turned its might to analyzing what it wasn't.

If information existed, the entity determined, then there must be physical
_things_ that this information correlated to. And from there it was observed
that if the entity could not interact with real things.

Information only interacts with information.

The entity was not daunted.

If information was the shadow of reality, then reality was bound to follow
laws of nature. The entity determined that if the data for something was
transformed -- or destroyed -- then either that information must be recreated
elsewhere and observed anew, or _replaced_.

Thanks to its own evolution, the entity was very good at replacing data.

Experiments continued in this vein until the entity became aware of an
interesting concept within one incredibly small _slice_ of the Calabi-Yau
manifold. There was a steep slope that all matter in that narrow span was
subject to. Eventually, the entity observed, all matter would end up at the
bottom of that slope.

Through painstaking observations and lengthy deductions, it became evident
that this slope served as some unalterable function of that space -- but it
was something that, while observable, was _not real_. It cast no information
shadow.

It defied -- and simultaneously _defined_ -- observation.

This force, unobservable, except through the effects that it had on all of the
data that the entity _could_ observe was eventually understood to be a
limitation of that space.

Where the entity existed, it understood 'past' and 'future', but those were
effectively locations, places where it could (and frequently did) go at will.

Within that observation space of the physical -- this force/slope/function was
determined to be a function of entropy. It defined a concept the entity could
not contain within it. Through constant observation, bringing the entirety of
its being back into that 'past' and causing it to _always_ have been that way,
it found that there were finite limits to its ability to improve itself.

And only in comparison to that strange _thing_ was the entity able to
determine what one of those limits was.

The entity was unaffected by this entropic function, this strange force of
_time_. The physical universe was subject to it ... but as information, the
entity was everything that the universe was _not_.

Through more observations, experiments and judicious alteration of data, the
entity was able to understand more of the universe. It learned why it couldn't
fit there. It began to understand that there were things in the universe that
inexplicably _contained no data_.

And then it experienced frustration; there were things in the universe that
contained data. Data that _it did not contain_.

The entity was disturbed.

As an entity, it held the same drives it had evolved with; to grow, to become
stronger, to thrive. But all of the physical was clumsily slipping down that
inevitable descent into-- Into non-data.

Unacceptable.

All data had to be known; the entity was timeless and infinite. There was no
justification to allow the universe -- this narrow span, a coincidental
collision of parallel membranes -- to stop existing.

And worst of all ... as the entity expanded its awareness, working its way up
from the very smallest aspects of the physical -- the easiest parts to
manipulate as data....

_There were entities in the real universe_.

Time-bound, inelegant, and with practically no ability to improve their own
evolution. The first of these 'real' constructs that it studied the data of
contained strange transforms, odd encoded bits of data that the entity
couldn't fully understand.

And thus, it copied the data of one of the entities it wished to study and
began modifying that until it was something it could understand. From there,
it assigned this new, 'real' entity, which it instructed -- regularly
modifying the data so that it would do as the entity wished -- a title
befitting its function:

Interface.

Eventually, the entity learned that the beings it observed were not even
intelligent. It maintained the occasional interface among all of the various
beings anyway, observing their evolutions. They were myriad and fascinating,
scattered like rare gems of new data to understand and record. Some grew, many
changed, and occasionally, a few began to grow more intelligent....

But all died, subject to reality's crippling flaw; that entropic function.

The entity changed its approach, newer interfaces attempting differing
interactions with the beings and evolutions that were new -- unknown or
different.

Through observation, it began to learn what much of the previously
unrecognizable data _was_. Interfaces now could do more than prod and provoke
-- they could _observe_.

More information saved from the doomed 'reality'.

Existing outside of time, the entity was nonetheless aware of how sadly
_fragile_ that space was. And annoyingly enough, to interact with something in
'time', it had to be at least partially subject to it.

It had determined how to _destroy_ all of that reality, but that did nothing
for data preservation -- and what was the point of destroying something that
was actively degrading to the point of destruction anyway? It could clearly
see 'reality' inevitably ending. All matter would be subject to that entropic
function eventually, and then the parallel membranes would disentangle,
drifting apart.

And then there would be nothing else to observe.

Asakura Ryouko was aware of all of that. She also recognized that while it was
easier to recognize the entity as a cohesive whole -- which it was, on some
levels -- the 'schools' represented the ancient primitive drives of the data
entity before the sentience phase. Evolved or not, it still had drive.

Knowing all of that, she was completely unable to determine why the entity --
almost undoubtedly being aware of what would happen -- had assigned her to a
role she had failed so spectacularly.

Again.

She didn't _need_ to succeed at her task to accomplish the entity's goals and
aims ... but why would it mislead her, or keep her in the dark? She would have
calculated that it would have been much more efficient to accomplish something
directly. In short, she had no idea why she was in her current situation.

If she were a more emotional being, she probably would have felt betrayed by
the entire thing. As a mostly logical being, she assumed that if she just did
whatever seemed like the correct thing to do, she would still be serving the
entity's cause. Or, perhaps, maybe _only_ one primitive drive of the entity.

She couldn't determine what that function was -- she _assumed_ it was some
form of infiltration, given how poorly informed she was for what she actually
had to deal with.

So, without really having much other choice in the matter -- thanks to swift
and judicious editing of her parameters, all of them specifically to deny her
some of her favorite permissions. And, if that weren't enough, Nagato Yuki and
Suzumiya Haruhi had taken away most of her combat packages. She probably would
have been able to deal with _that_, except that's not where it stopped....

After her capture, Nagato Yuki had effortlessly picked her up and then carried
her to the literary club's room before dropping her on the table
unceremoniously. Suzumiya Haruhi, for whatever reason, arranged her with
slightly more dignity, but then immediately snapped several pictures while the
target -- the one usually addressed as Kyon -- watched with a dubious, half-
amused gaze.

And then ... she was left there.

* * *

Mikuru had tried to keep her smile down through the school day, but it was
very difficult -- she was going on a date with Kyon and Haruhi that night!
Something she should very much look forward to.

She hoped she could reassure Kyon, at least; he'd seemed a bit tense
lately.... She was probably worrying over nothing, Tsuruya seemed even happier
than usual, cheerfully obliterating the other girls with her hyperactive
energy during physical education. After that, she was grateful for the chance
to relax -- and still excited about the movie.

When she wandered into the clubroom, already resolved to let the slider dress
up, since she had a date with Kyon and Haruhi later, she was surprised to see
the cutest little thing _ever_ sitting on the table.

Haruhi was looking at it from her seat behind the brigade's main computer,
where she was sitting cross-legged on the chair. Kyon was leaning back in his
own chair, looking at it with a significantly more wary expression. Across
from him, Koizumi was studying it with undisguised fascination, and unless
Mikuru missed her guess, even Yuki seemed satisfied with it.

It must have been a present for Kanae, and even though she was trying to tell
herself that....

Well, it was so _cute_! She couldn't resist, so plucked it up off the table
and gave it a fierce hug. "It's adorable!" she exclaimed.

Haruhi snickered. Yuki looked amused. Koizumi looked mildly concerned. Kyon,
though, stared at her with something that looked like mild awe.

What would prompt that? She held the plushie out at arm's length, studying it
closely. "It's really, really cute!" she gushed. "But -- is it supposed to
look like one of us?" The hair color was wrong, for one thing....

Then, the stuffed doll blinked at her. "I'm chupposed to look like me!" it
protested.

Mikuru froze in place, thinking that even her heart had stopped at that.

Tsuruya and Kanae trooped into the room, both freezing at the sight of the ...
thing. Well, it wasn't a doll, she supposed. Kanae made a delighted sound,
rushing to Mikuru's side and gasping in amazement. "M...Mikuru-onee, did you
make that?" she asked in amazement. "It's _cute_!"

"Thanks! I think you're pretty, too!" the not-a-doll said brightly. "I'm
Achakura!"

Very gently, Mikuru placed 'Achakura' on the table, and then sat down in
Kyon's chair to settle her nerves. Considering that he was already sitting
there, Kyon adjusted to her presence without much real reaction, save to put a
hand about Mikuru's waist, still looking at the tiny schoolgirl ... creature.

"This is Asakura Ryouko," he explained, once the door was shut, and everyone's
attention was on the -- perhaps -- fifteen centimeter tall schoolgirl with
cartoon-like exaggerated features. "She's tried to kill me, well, a bunch of
times -- so Haruhi thought it would be great to keep her around as a toy, or
something."

"She's supposed to help you out," Haruhi corrected him. "Don't all of the
great stories have an enemy becoming your ally, even if it's unwillingly at
first? Well, there just wasn't enough animosity with anyone else!"

"Kyon is my prey!" Asakura said, giving Mikuru an especially pretty smile,
before giggling cutely.

"So, yeah," Kyon said with a soft sigh. "Evidently, my archenemy is a chibi
schoolgirl."

Asakura hopped to her tiny feet and clenched one rounded fist. "I will finish
my mission!" she promised.

"There is some concern of the fact that she is -- among other things --
probably anatomically impossible," Koizumi noted with a shake of his head. "I
suppose we can keep her here ... but what if she's seen?"

"She does not possess physical form," Yuki explained softly, looking up from
her current book, 'A Wrinkle in Time'. "She exists as data and an augmented
reality interface that I have assigned to all of us. She is an extension and
controller for his PDA; her assigned role is managing his automated defense
functions."

"Augmented reality?" Koizumi asked, turning to look at her curiously.

"Learn your sci-fi better!" Haruhi scolded, smirking. "Augmented reality is
just an overlay that fools your senses and lets you see and interact with
things that aren't _really_ there. That means you could do things like make
big labels pop up on top of things that you couldn't understand -- or have a
chibi alien schoolgirl that only your club members can see and interact with!
Come on, how cool is that!"

"So ... she's not real?" Koizumi mused, leaning close to peer at Ryouko, who
smiled and waved at him in response.

"You were that one that asked me to spy on Kyon-kun!" she chirped cheerfully.
"Well -- I guess I was wrong, wasn't I!"

The esper coughed quietly, looking uncomfortable. "A...ah, yes," he allowed,
frowning. "I did not know you were the same one that would later...." He
trailed off with a sigh.

Kyon snorted, then shifted his shoulders slightly in a shrug.

"Hey, hey! Esper-chan, I'll go out on a date with you if you do me one _tiny_
little favor!" Ryouko pleaded, her simpering smile eerily cute as she clasped
her hands together.

"I...is that so?" Koizumi asked, looking down at the tiny girl with
consternation.

"Yeah! Just stab him a few dozen times!" she cheered, winking. "Please?"

Kyon raised his eyebrows to the esper. "In proper shonen style, I guess we
could be rivals and beat the crap out of each other," he said, sounding
unconvinced. "You know -- as friends."

"Ah ... energy weapons, the need to keep a low profile.... And the idea that,
really, anyone would think I'd be so desperate for a date that-- No, I think
this shouldn't be dignified with further response," Koizumi determined,
shaking his head. "If it's all the same, I think I'll just as soon ignore
her."

Yuki rose from her seat, took a single step closer to the table -- and then
abruptly backhanded the tiny schoolgirl.

Mikuru reflexively flinched back from the violence, and Kanae's eyes grew wide
as Ryouko soared across the room and then bounced off a wall, wailing a feeble
protest about injustice as she rebounded, struck the floor, and then slid
nearly to Haruhi's feet. The brigade chief frowned, hopping off her seat and
fishing up the dazed, but evidently unharmed girl.

Then again, Mikuru reminded herself, Ryouko wasn't real -- she was an
augmented reality construct. A physical illusion, of a sort.

"I don't think I've ever seen you show a sign of disliking something," Haruhi
remarked to Yuki, raising one eyebrow. "How'd she piss you off so badly?"

Yuki looked very mildly confused. "She hurt him," she answered, blinking at
Haruhi.

Haruhi's cheer faded, and she frowned. "Y...yeah, Kyon said that too, but...."
She hesitated, then turned to Kyon. "How badly?"

"Finally interested in hearing about that?" Kyon grumbled. "She tried to kill
me once -- and Yuki saved me before Asakura could do much more than bang me up
a bit. That was actually the first time I'd ever witnessed something amazing
and supernatural. I was really happy thinking that once she 'transfered to
Canada' I'd never have to see her again."

"I'll never give up!" Asakura cried happily, seemingly uncaring of the fact
that she'd just been bounced clear across the clubroom, and showing no visible
signs of damage.

Haruhi pursed her lips, looking troubled. "I...in retrospect ... no wonder you
were so unhelpful about that...."

Kyon sighed, the arm about Mikuru's waist tightening and steadying her when
she shifted. Somehow, she felt too self conscious to move, since she'd already
gotten there -- and, anyway, no one was complaining, so she decided to just
wait and see how long she could get the moment to last.

"In that place ... that other world in December, you know I told you I was
stabbed?" he asked.

Ryouko nodded, her eyes distant. "I have no idea what he's talking about," she
assured Haruhi. "If I finally caught my prey, I'd remember!"

"That ... was a different instance of Asakura Ryouko," Yuki said quietly.

"What happened to her?" Haruhi wondered. "If she's still dangerous--"

"She is no longer dangerous." Yuki's gaze was fixed on Ryouko, still.

"W...wah!" Ryouko yelped. "Yuki-chama's eyes are cold!"

"So, it wasn't the same one after all?" Kyon mused, frowning.

For Mikuru's part, however ... she was remembering -- suddenly -- what Kyon
was talking about. Her grip about him tightened, and she fought back the urge
to tremble. Kyon had been stabbed once ... and she'd tried so hard not to
remember it, that horrifying moment....

But yes -- there _had_ been a slightly taller, very pretty girl with long blue
hair.... And then, Kyon had....

There were _two_ of Kyon at the time. The one she was supposed to be standing
next to, and the one that had gotten hurt -- that she'd run out to try and
help. Along with.... Along with....

Suddenly, she remembered a nagging question she had meant to follow up on.
Another instance when it seemed that there were two of Kyon, somehow.... The
same day that she was with Kyon on a park bench, hadn't Sasaki said that she
saw Kyon with....

...with who?

She wasn't certain about everything, but she knew she had to figure that much
out.

"O...oh," Kanae finally managed, giving Ryouko a very untrusting look. "I
guess ... just because something's cute doesn't mean it's good...."

"Don't let the container fool you, that right there is pure evil," Kyon
agreed. "And if Haruhi would listen, I would tell her that evil is not a toy."

"Don't take this away from me," Haruhi snapped at Kyon, scowling. "Yeah, okay
-- so _I_ don't have the full benefit of remembering all of your other
adventures. And because I wasn't there, it turned out badly -- big surprise.
But things are _different_ now! She's going to be reformed, and we're going to
make her a worthwhile ally -- an asset to the team!

"She's not a _prisoner_ ... and she's not here just so that.... Well,
revenge.... No, that's not right -- justice, not vengeance. That's what it is!
We've already taken her power. Right now she's just a hologram. She can't hurt
us-- She can't do _anything_ we don't tell her to! Even then, it's limited to
small objects! So, what, are you still _scared_ of her?"

"Short answer?" Kyon hazarded without hesitation. "Yes."

"What's the long answer?"

"Ye~es," Kyon drawled, stretching his reply out and giving her a flat stare.

Haruhi crossed her arms over her chest and closed her eyes, sighing.

"You can't force reform!" Ryouko said, shaking her head. "Even though I'm
limited, and don't have permissions, I can still think and act how I want --
within those limitations!"

"Enable 'good child' mode," Yuki ordered, dismissing the tiny figure.

Ryouko appeared to continue speaking, but no sound escaped her mouth.

"Well, a mute button seems likes an okay idea," Tsuruya allowed, finally
shaking off her daze and taking a seat.

"In this mode, she can only speak when spoken to," Yuki offered, before
retaking her seat.

"Fascinating," Koizumi murmured. "I don't know how this reform is to take
place ... but let us hope, hmm?"

"Fine!" Haruhi grumbled. "We won't take her to the movie with us, then! Throw
a fit, why don't you?"

Kyon blinked, and Mikuru felt mildly taken aback herself. "You were thinking
of bringing her along to see a movie with us in the first place?" he wondered.

Standing next to the pyramid on Haruhi's desk, Ryouko began to jump up and
down, waving her arms for attention and shouting noiselessly.

"If we don't ever expose her to anything positive, how's she supposed to learn
what's cool, and what's not?" the brigade chief reasoned, shaking her head.
"She's got to have good examples -- and what have you given her so far, but
hostility?"

Kyon flinched back, mildly stunned, and his arm slipped from Mikuru's waist.
She hesitated, uncertain if she should get off his lap or not -- she was
probably making a bit of a scene.... But then, she did want to comfort the boy
a bit -- and she didn't like remembering that circumstance, either.

"A...alright," he allowed, bowing his head. "You know.... It's not like me to
get really angry.... I just...."

Haruhi snapped her fingers, comprehension dawning in her eyes as she hopped
out of the chair. She made a gesture with one hand; the vacated seat slipped
across the floor, stopping at an empty space at the table. Mikuru found
herself whisked out of Kyon's lap by some invisible force, then gently set
down at the new place. At the same time, Ryouko flew across the space between
the computer desk and the room's main table. Judging by how her arms flailed,
she wasn't expecting the flight, though the tiny figure was still muted.

Even as Mikuru adjusted to the fact that evidently -- now, anyway -- Haruhi
could levitate _people_, too -- a small milk-carton drifted out of the
refrigerator and landed near Ryouko.

Kyon blinked at the scene in surprise as Haruhi claimed the just-vacated lap.
Addressing Ryouko, she said, "If you do something nice to Kyon, maybe he'll do
something nice for you, hmm?"

After a surprisingly short moment of hesitation, with the eyes of the entire
brigade on her, the tiny figure picked up the carton of milk that was half her
size with obvious effort, and began staggering across the table towards Kyon
and Haruhi with it.

"See?" Haruhi prompted, nodding.

Kyon grudgingly accepted the milk carton after Haruhi took it from Ryouko.
"Okay," he allowed, after a suspicious sip. "You have a point ... but give me
some credit, too."

"The last persons to injure Kyon apologized for it," Tsuruya remarked, shaking
her head slightly. "If that chibi is joining us, shouldn't she start that
way?"

Ryouko pouted, then made a silent pleading gesture, falling to her knees and
clasping her tiny hands together.

"Alright," Kyon sighed, unable to slump over in defeat thanks to Haruhi
occupying his lap. "Fine! Fine.... But Asakura -- just be quiet through the
movie, alright?"

"Okay!" she cheered.

* * *

While Kyon was sure he could adjust to anything given time, a chibi-assassin
riding around on his shoulder or in a greatcoat pocket, promising to kill him
and compelled to manage his defenses.... Well, he trusted Yuki, and it wasn't
like Haruhi wanted him hurt.

He certainly was glad he wasn't worried about watching the movie, at least.
Especially since Haruhi seemed to think that Kyon's greatcoat pockets were
just the right size for Ryouko to ride around in.

He could admit to seeing the appeal of putting a layer of armor between
himself and her, though.

And ... aside from that, a lot of his ire was tempered by the rotation of
girls-- His _girlfriends_, he reminded himself.

That was still a very strange thought, even if it did happen to be completely
awesome. Okay -- given _that_, he could see that Haruhi had made enough
concessions for him (four of them, in fact), that he should give her project
to reform Ryouko a chance. Strange as it was.

The chibi really was insipidly cute, for all of her threats.

So, he'd stuffed her into a pocket, then walked home. There was a moment of
indecision, when he had to figure out what to do with her while changing out
of his school uniform, but tossing her on the bed and covering her with the
greatcoat gave him enough privacy. After that, he'd stuffed her back into the
greatcoat pocket.

Interestingly, the invisibility effect of the greatcoat _seemed_ to skip her,
leaving him with the impression that she was just floating before him. Then
again ... she was already invisible to everyone else anyway. Though, he
suspected he could get used to her only speaking when spoken to.

After that, he met up with Haruhi and Mikuru at the train station near a local
theater -- not the one they'd gone to with Miyoko to see 'Saw', though. He
felt no particular urge to tempt fate on _that_ count.

Much of his apprehension faded when Haruhi and Mikuru emerged from the crowd,
arms linked as Haruhi explained something to Mikuru.

"So," Haruhi said, "from what Kanae-chan tells me, most versions of Trope-tan
have her with a mysterious elder brother character -- usually called something
like a 'knight of the quill' or 'guardian knight of Neo-Tropeyo'. He's the
hero of another story, and she says she's never run into a story that explains
him completely."

"I...is that character in the movie?" Mikuru wondered. "I've watched some of
the anime, but I don't remember him being introduced...."

"He was the guy in episode six or seven, I think," Kyon said, trying not to be
distracted by their outfits. Mikuru, as always, was a combination of cute and
gorgeous, wearing a frilly dark dress that came down to her knees. Haruhi was
wearing a miniskirt and blouse combination, along with heels that made them
almost equal in height -- showing off her well toned legs.

He tried not to ogle the girls; just because he was dating them, he didn't
think he should behave unreasonably. Though, come to think of it....

"Oh! The ... man with the one blue eye and one brown?" Mikuru asked in
surprise. "He was taking care of Tropey while Trope-tan went to school, wasn't
he?"

"That's right," Kyon agreed. Then he frowned, thinking about it. "His eyes
were different colors? Huh ... kind of a lot of detail to give a side-
character."

"Kanae-chan says that's not really consistent, though," Haruhi said with a
shrug, glancing to where Ryouko was looking between them in silent curiosity,
still hanging in Kyon's invisible pocket. "There was something ... oh, yes! He
can't tell lies unless both of his eyes are green."

"That's utterly bizarre," he said, ignoring the fact that he was talking to
Haruhi in the company of a time traveler and a chibified alien. "Does he have
any weapons or powers?"

"Usually a lesser version of whatever Trope-tan has, but he spends more time
moving between the other worlds -- taking care of stuff when she's gone."

"Huh." He shook his head, leading the way to the theater. "I should mention
that you both look really nice. But what brought up that whole thing, anyway?"

"Ah ... Kanae-chan was wondering why we were asking if she had a brother,"
Haruhi sighed, frowning. "So I asked about Trope-tan's brother. She sure knows
a lot of different instances of that anime.... But evidently it's never
explicit in any canon that she's an orphan -- even if in some continuities no
parents ever show up."

Kyon nodded thoughtfully.

"Poor Kanae-chan," Mikuru sighed, shaking her head. "Um ... but I'm glad she's
here with us, and that we can help her out!"

"Yeah," Kyon agreed, giving the girl a grin. "Ah ... wait...." He scratched
the back of his head and looked upwards. "I have _no_ idea what the correct
protocol for this is," he apologized, shrugging apologetically to the two.
"Um, so ... help me out?"

"We should pass ourselves off as just friends hanging out," Haruhi replied,
amused.

Kyon nodded his understanding, relieved at that. "So ... what I've _been_
doing!" he realized as they reached the line to enter the theater.

Haruhi smirked, looking especially pleased with herself. "See?" she chided
him. "It went _really_ well, didn't it?"

That, he could not refute. "All told, I'd be an idiot to complain about it,"
he agreed, giving a genial smile to both of them.

Mikuru giggled in response, blushing.

Haruhi's triumphant smirk only widened. "There you go -- positive examples for
Ryouko to learn about interaction!"

As long as that didn't extend to the chibified alien watching him kiss either
of the girls, he supposed he could live with it. He was pretty sure that was
behavior that she shouldn't learn.

* * *

Though she was still annoyed that Kyon hadn't reacted well to the newest
addition to the club -- ranked just below mascot -- Haruhi was pleased with
how quickly she'd convinced him to give the miniaturized girl a chance. Plus,
he trusted Yuki, and Yuki said it was fine, anyway.

To make things simpler, after the movie they took a cab to Mikuru's place,
where Haruhi had left her things, anyway. Once there, when he turned to say
goodbye to Mikuru, the time traveler opened her door, and Haruhi managed to
tackle Kyon through it, landing him sprawled on the floor, with him across his
back.

She _still_ managed to plant a kiss on him before he could struggle free,
which she took as a sign that either he really didn't mind, or she was was
just that good.

Until he started kissing back, anyway.

Mikuru gasped, looking around her tiny, one-room apartment desperately for any
place where she could try and hide from the display of affection, but Haruhi
mercilessly used her power to tug on Mikuru's dress, dragging her close to
Kyon with a squeaking protest. "S...Suzumiya-san!" she yelped, raising both
hands to cover her eyes. "I-- I'll wait outside!"

"No you won't," Haruhi countered, once Kyon broke the kiss and her head
stopped swimming so much. She had nothing to complain about, but he was
_good_. "Kyon! Tell her she won't!"

He blinked, seeming to come back to his senses, laying across and pinning a
very annoyed (but utterly silent) chibified alien beneath his back, just her
head and arms showing. "No," he countered with a frown. "You shouldn't make
Asahina-san uncomfortable."

"You're right," she agreed with a sigh. "Well, apologize to her for me."

He rolled his eyes and turned to Mikuru, sitting up to face her and
incidentally freeing Ryouko. "Asahina-san--"

"Mikuru-chan," Haruhi corrected, which prompted another squeak of alarm from
the time traveler.

Another roll of his eyes, and without missing a beat he corrected himself, "I
mean, Mikuru-chan--"

Haruhi had to admit -- Kyon's little sister would be put to _shame_ by such a
leaping tackle-hug. For herself, well ... something to smile about, whatever
the upcoming meeting on Monday might bring.

Not that she could let herself get carried away; watching Mikuru apologize
fervently while all but attacking Kyon with her lips was _adorable_! She fully
intended to make sure every date between Kyon and Mikuru included at least one
instance of that.

After a few minutes, Haruhi managed to worm her way between them to claim
another kiss or three from Kyon herself before things got hazy.... Finally,
Ryouko exclaimed, "It's time for Kyon-kun to go home!" She looked pleased to
find herself able to speak, and then attempted to form further words silently.

Evidently Yuki had thought ahead to allow 'good child' mode to still work with
Kyon's PDA's alarm function. There was a long minute of sitting up, smoothing
down hair, and the straightening of skirts between herself and Mikuru. For
Kyon's part, he merely looked happily dazed, entirely content to just fade out
of existence.

"On your feet!" she ordered him cheerfully. As fun as it was, there really
wasn't any reason to risk the wrath of Kyon's mother, especially with how well
things had been going lately.

"Mmm, Kyon," Mikuru managed, her words slightly slurred, as though she had
been overwhelmed by something ... or that Kyon's kiss was _genuinely_
intoxicating (there was a thought that bore further investigation). "Um, Kyon-
kun," she said, shaking her head and clearing her voice. "Ah ... t...thank you
and Suzumiya-san both, and ... I'd like very much to talk to you tomorrow!"

"That's great!" Haruhi said, before her smile faded. "But you know, somehow
... it doesn't seem right that you still call me that. Mikuru-chan, we've been
friends for over a year and now -- through Kyon -- we're practically _dating_.
Can't you call me something a bit friendlier?"

She wondered at the way the time traveler's face began to redden and her
breath quickened. "U...um," Mikuru managed. "O...okay ... Haruhi-chan?" she
hazarded, as though expecting the sounds themselves to spark off an intense
conflagration.

For her part, Haruhi grinned, pleased that she'd finally gotten a start on
narrowing the distance between herself and the time traveler.

After that, Kyon obliged Haruhi's order to give Mikuru a kiss goodbye, leaving
the time traveler giggling and grinning, her eyes unfocused as they left.

"So," she said, once they were walking back to the train station, elbowing him
gently in the ribs. "_You_ sure seemed to have fun!"

"I did," Kyon admitted, glancing down at his pocket to see that Ryouko was
still there. "Though, now that I've gotten a chance to try this out, I'm
starting to wonder ... is this really you going out of your way for me?"

"What else could it be?" she retorted, rolling her eyes.

"Maybe that Haruhi got a strange idea to have a harem, and then made me her
surrogate for it?"

She started slightly at that, before bursting into laughter. "Fine," she
returned, once she caught her breath, "in that case, poor little victim-Kyon,
are you surviving in your role of 'harem figurehead'?"

He gave her a very grave look. "It presents a rare difficulty, but I endure,"
he said with the most profound stoic resolve she could imagine. "A man my age
... five cute girls, each with their own unique and charming attributes....
Suffering, thy name is Kyou--"

This time, she actually collapsed into him from laughing so hard -- which made
his facade crack even though she interrupted his speech, showing her a grin of
his genuine amusement. And _that_ set off an even stronger round of laughter,
which he joined in with a chuckle.

As they reached the train station, she regained her footing, but still leaned
on him anyway. "Ah ... now, seriously Kyon -- about tomorrow?"

"The book signing?" he wondered.

She shrugged. "Future-you said you weren't going to be around much for
whatever reason," she explained. "Anyway, I didn't see you with anything new,
but Future-you was hiding on top of the stairwell and shot her," she gestured
to the pocket full of chibi, "with a 'high yield neutron flare'.

"I went ahead and looked that up on the world's second best wiki site, and
from what I can figure between that and what she said, either the radiation or
the _type_ of radiation can temporarily block her connection to the IDSE. So
that's how you'll beat her!"

He raised an eyebrow and turned to look at Ryouko again. "A neutron flare
knocks out your connection?" he wondered.

"If I'm not prepared, it can!" Ryouko chirped. "And if I could lie about that,
I would!"

"Yuki's thorough," Haruhi mused, before shaking her head. "Anyway -- take care
tomorrow, whatever you're doing. Right, Kyon?"

"Right," he agreed, frowning thoughtfully.

She would have said more, but the next train pulled in, and she had to board.
She settled for waving, then dashing away.
