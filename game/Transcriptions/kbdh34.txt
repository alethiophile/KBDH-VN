"Chapter Three: Field Training"

"Once you've established your basic level of competence, there's nothing to
remind you of how far you have to go quite like trying to do something by
yourself."

For the most part, Kyon's schedule had seemed to fill up. Before, he was so
reliably idle (except when he was with Haruhi) that Koizumi could expect to
request his time, and get it. Now, he was so busy with his suddenly adopted
responsibilities that Koizumi found himself struggling to get some of the
other boy's time.

Take the current situation, where Koizumi was uncomfortably certain that he'd
only managed to get Kyon's attention for the length of the lunch period
because Haruhi seemed to want to round the other girls up to discuss
something. What, Koizumi wasn't certain. While he had once prided himself on
his ability to predict Haruhi's behavior, at this point Kyon was the expert,
and that was that.

No longer being so directly ... _connected_ to Haruhi had gone a long way
towards allowing the esper to take a less ... involved viewpoint. He didn't
understand what her plans or outlook towards having a relationship were, but
it seemed to satisfy her for the moment, and Kyon likewise seemed to have the
situation well enough in hand.

But the two of them took seats outside, where other students seldom bothered
to show up. Kyon glanced around, shifting his shoulders, then unwrapped the
bento that Haruhi had presumably made for him. "So," Koizumi said, unwrapping
the lunch he had made himself, "I suppose I'll open the discussion?"

"That's how it usually works," Kyon agreed after swallowing a mouthful of
sliced carrots. "But I already know what your first question is. I checked
with Nagato last night, and she said that she didn't catch any sign of Haruhi
trying to use her powers to change how yours worked at the beach."

Koizumi blinked, turning that over. "So, Suzumiya-san goes beyond Nagato-san's
control?" he posed cautiously.

Kyon shook his head in sharp negation. "It happened the last night there was
closed space, I think," he ventured. "Nagato thinks you just never tried to
use your powers since then."

"W...well," Koizumi managed, shaken. It couldn't have been that he'd been
empowered for more than a _month_ and just never tried to use his powers? But
then, why would he? "T...to be fair," he followed up, smiling unsteadily, "my
powers originally came with the knowledge of how they worked. When
modifications occurred, well, I suppose as Suzumiya-san might say, there were
no new patch notes!"

"And I guess you don't have much of a community for support," the other boy
agreed, smirking. "Next order of business?"

"On the subject of Suzumiya-san and the fact that her powers may still work
around whatever limitations that Nagato has imposed," Koizumi began, pulling
his chopsticks from their case, "I have some concern that she may still have
the ability to influence the greater scale of events."

Kyon pondered that while chewing his next mouthful of food, swallowing before
he asked, "Meaning?"

"I think that it's possible that her subconscious mind may actually still be
able to manipulate reality. Consider that as soon as you introduced Suzumiya-
san to the very things she desired to meet, our dynamic began to change? You
presented information to her that in some ways made it seem that an adventure
novel, or a science fiction movie were happening, all just barely concealed
from her perception."

"That precept doesn't strike me as false," Kyon countered. "In fact, it seems
wholly defensible on my part: in reality, some days _were_ science fiction
movies, adventure novels, and so on!"

"And more so now," Koizumi noted. "Or, as I'm beginning to suspect, it is
because of the expectations that you have set for her that things have turned
out this way."

Kyon froze mid-chew, and Koizumi took a moment to have a few bites of his own
lunch. He noted that at least Kyon had stopped to seriously consider the
implications. As it was, despite no longer being able to read the girl, the
esper was still fairly confident that things were going to work out alright.

"Strangely," he continued, setting his chopsticks down and sipping from his
canned juice, "I find that I'm not actually greatly concerned about it. I said
once that you and Suzumiya-san believed in one-another, that it was a mutual
confidence that I was envious of. Ultimately, the fact of that trust is the
safety net that makes me so confident about the situation at hand."

After taking a sip from his own drink, Kyon prompted, "How's that?"

Koizumi shrugged again, giving the other boy a relaxed, amused smile. "You
believe that Suzumiya-san doesn't actually intend harm, so you're not afraid
of what she might do. She believes that as long as you are at her side, she
cannot be defeated. As long as you two are together...." He trailed off,
deciding that the rest did not need to be said.

Kyon stared into his bento with a thoughtful look. "I actually considered this
possibility some time ago," he relented. "It's difficult to determine, really,
if this is happening because that's what Haruhi wants, or if this is just a
side-effect of opposing the IDSE."

The esper sat back slightly, considering that. "So, are you saying that ...
the IDSE has caused you to become involved in the affairs of the Tsuruya
family?" And thus caused him to become engaged, along that line of thought.
"That's very subtle."

Kyon shook his head. "They are in general, though. Really, it's the sliders
who are showy. And maybe the sneering bastard. I wouldn't be surprised if
they're behind whatever provoked the Sumiyoshi-rengo, or they're trying to
help the mystery operative who's trying to use the Tamaru brothers as bait,"
he noted. "After all, the original incident was prompted by remnants of data
from another interface ... which are now stored securely in this
indestructible container." He set his new PDA on the table.

"Quite so," Koizumi agreed, glancing at the shiny black and chrome object. "At
any rate, while I don't mind working with you, especially now that I know I'm
better able to keep pace with you, as it goes, I would like to discuss a title
change."

"Sounds like something Haruhi's going to have to approve," Kyon said with a
shrug. "But, what's on your mind, then?"

"'Sidekick' sounds a bit dated, doesn't it? In this day and age, wouldn't
'personal assistant' be more apt?" the esper suggested.

"I guess," Kyon answered doubtfully. "Well, it's not like we're superheroes,
going out and fighting crime, or anything like that."

"All the same, I'd like to be more than just a decoy on the battlefield."

"Since you took apart that thing on the beach, I think we've safely
established that I was significantly more of a decoy than you," Kyon retorted.

Chuckling, Koizumi ducked his head. "True enough," he admitted. "All the
same...."

"Ask Haruhi," the vice-commander reiterated, shaking his head. "Anyway ...
what are your thoughts on this invasion?"

"It's frustrating not being able to do anything but wait," the esper said
after a thoughtful minute, while Kyon polished off the rest of his bento. "I
believe Suzumiya-san is annoyed, too, but not enough to try and push for any
change. After all, should we not savor these calm, quiet moments when we have
them?"

"I don't like the idea of them being so rare that we must, but you're probably
right," Kyon grumbled. "Alright, then, any other business?"

"Nothing in particular," Koizumi assured him, shaking his head. At least that
much was certain. "Unless you wish to goad Suzumiya to act first...."

"Let's not throw rocks at that beehive," Kyon suggested, smirking. "Alright,
well, let me know if anything changes, then. Thanks, Koizumi."

"Glad to help a friend when I can, Kyon-kun," Koizumi returned, pleased at the
honesty of the remark. Kyon's expression didn't betray much, but the esper
could tell the other boy had caught that as he nodded farewell.

There were significantly worse people to work for, he thought, wrapping his
leftovers up.

* * *

Somewhat distracted by the time she had spent visiting with Sakanaka the
previous day, Haruhi's steps as she strode towards the club room were slower
than usual. The excitable little terrier was just as energetic as the last
time Haruhi had seen him, and Sakanaka's mother had seemed more relaxed at
Haruhi's presence than before.

Then again, Yuki and Mikuru had basically enacted some strange occult-seeming
ritual involving a dog and a cat, with the time traveler dressed up as a
shrine maiden. Or maybe she was just leery of letting her daughter alone with
a group containing boys.

Either way, she ducked into the room to give the girls a tray of snacks and a
pitcher of iced tea, and then seemed too busy with her own project in some
distant corner of the massive house to do more than check in occasionally.

Sakanaka had asked a few shy questions about Haruhi's relationship with Kyon
-- which she had awkwardly evaded, not enjoying concealing things from someone
she wanted to call a friend. It had gone easier once she managed to ask
Sakanaka who she was interested in.

The other girl had blushed very deeply and admitted only that she liked
someone who she thought was very intelligent, though, lately had seemed to be
a bit stressed. Haruhi wanted nothing more than to demand to know who it was
Sakanaka liked and then pressure her into confessing to him -- or her, she
supposed.

Of course, she restrained herself. Pushing Sakanaka to achieve some more
definitive form of relationship than she'd managed to cobble together wasn't
fair to either of them.

Still, the realization that she had limited herself -- all of them, really --
from being able to define what they were....

That would not do long-term, even if it did help settle Kyon down. By the time
she reached the club room, she roused herself from her thoughts; she'd already
had a planning session at lunch with the other girls, anyway. All she really
needed to do was get Kyon to agree to her proposed trip to visit his uncle and
aunts in Hinamizawa next month.

She turned to look at him before opening the door to the club room, realizing
he seemed a bit less energetic than usual. "What's got you down, subordinate?"
she chided, finding a smile for him, anyway. "You didn't tell me how your
family dinner went last night, either!"

He snorted, shaking his head. "Just generically tired, I guess," he answered,
glancing down the hall as Koizumi approached, Yuki a step behind him. "I used
to be able to nap during class ... I miss that sleep."

"Give me a week," she replied resolutely. "Then I'll be done figuring out the
assignment patterns from all of our teachers, and we can start doing classwork
and homework a few days in advance."

He stared at her, eyes widening. "That's how you can sleep through the last
part of every term?" he asked. "I knew you could calculate impossible things
things with your unreasonable genius, but that far?"

"It's not rocket surgery," she chided as she felt her face heat up, scowling
as she opened the door to the club room and turned to face Kyon. "It's basic
psychology, plus the fact that almost no teacher in all of Japan deviates from
an approved lesson plan! Haven't I called every single pop quiz this year, at
least two days in advance? I thought you could read people! Come on, it's
easy, right Yuki-chan?" In fact, she believed wholeheartedly that even Kyon
could do it, if he could just muster the willpower to focus for the duration
of his classes! Only his laziness held him back.

Yuki gave a tiny nod of agreement, though her gaze was somewhere past Haruhi's
shoulder. So was Kyon's. Koizumi was staring, too, so Haruhi turned around
quickly, chagrined to realized that somehow, Mikuru had gotten to the club
room before them and was in the middle of changing. She lunged through the
door towards the time traveler and slammed it shut behind her. "Sorry!" she
called, turning to face the crimson-faced Mikuru. "T...that was an accident!"

"I...it's okay," Mikuru mumbled, taking a mincing half-step backward and then
quickly squirming the rest of the way into her outfit. Haruhi was sorely
tempted to help her out, but knew that the older girl was still a bit nervous
around her. In fact, when she stopped to think about it, the distance between
Haruhi and Mikuru seemed the greatest between any of the girls of the SOS
Brigade....

Mikuru finished pulling the outfit on and straightening it out, giving Haruhi
a worried glance and putting one hand to her hair. "I...is something wrong?"
she asked anxiously, her face still red.

"No," Haruhi said quickly, shaking her head. "I just thought that you looked
really cute in that outfit." Given Mikuru's recent lessons, the brigade chief
personally thought the nurse outfit would have been more appropriate. Still,
if she wanted to wear the maid outfit, that was up to her. "Hmm, Mikuru-chan,
I think you're falling behind, so why don't you ask Kyon to do something with
you tonight?"

"Eh!" Mikuru started, her eyes widening as she blinked in surprise.
"R...really?" she asked hopefully. "T...that's okay?"

"Of course!" Haruhi insisted, opening the door again and motioning the others
in. "Consider it my apology!"

"What's that?" Kyon asked, stepping in with the rest of the club members,
Tsuruya and Kanae having arrived while the door was shut.

"To make up for your trying to peep on Mikuru-chan while she's changing,
you're sentenced to manual labor for her," Haruhi explained, going to the
computer and turning it on. She could hardly expect to demand time alone with
him if she wasn't allowing the same for the other girls. "We'll call it
community service."

"Oh, right," Kyon said with a nod. "That makes perfect sense."

"Um ... if it's not too much trouble," Mikuru asked him meekly, managing a shy
smile, "c...could you help me with some shopping tonight, Kyon-kun?"

He glanced at his PDA, then nodded. "Of course," he agreed.

"Ah! Thank you, Kyon-kun!" Mikuru began to hum contentedly as she turned her
attention to the tea set.

"Say, Haruhi, Koizumi wanted to ask you for a favor, too."

Haruhi blinked and glanced up from the computer's loading screen. "What's
that?" she asked the esper, curious.

"Ah," the boy said, ducking his head as Kanae began to spread her homework
across the table in front of her, "well, I asked Kyon-kun about this earlier
and he seemed agreeable. I was hoping for a title change from sidekick to
personal assistant, if that's not too much trouble...?"

She blinked, considering that. "Well, you're still technically a sidekick,"
she warned him. "But, yeah, that's an okay title. I think it'll fit in better
for some of Kyon's 'business' with Tsu-chan's family anyway, right?"

The heiress nodded enthusiastically. "You betcha!" she agreed. "Speakings of
which, meeting on Wednesday, Kyon-kun. My father wants to discuss somethings."

Haruhi gave a satisfied nod, and turned her attention back to the computer. As
annoying as it was, she would try resisting her inevitable need to drag Kyon
off to her favorite stairwell ... for a while, at least.

* * *

After club had ended, Kyon had waited outside for Mikuru to change before the
pair of them left the school together. Koizumi had gone with Tsuruya, to
discuss some bit of their work -- something the time traveler suspected would
reach Kyon shortly. Haruhi had found out about yet another poor test score
(history, again) from Kanae and announced an emergency study session at
Yuki's, and the slider was reluctantly dragged off.

Not that the time traveler begrudged any of the others, and wouldn't have
minded having any of them along, but time where she could be with Kyon by
herself.... Of course, technically, she _was_ allowed to 'date' Kyon,
according to Haruhi. She hadn't bothered asking any of her superiors; the
anonymous, mysterious bosses from the future, or Kyon, who she was subordinate
to, technically. After all, if she considered that Kyon's superior was Haruhi,
that meant that if she didn't think about it too hard, Mikuru could pretend
that the 'date' override had come from Kyon himself.

He didn't need to know that, of course....

So she walked side-by-side with him through the same shopping district where
she had gone looking for new clothes with Yuki, and once, just earlier that
year, asked Kyon to help her purchase the sewing machine that had allowed the
creation of such nice costumes. "I need some blue cloth for Kanae-chan's
costume," Mikuru told Kyon, who was scanning the crowd thoughtfully, both of
their bags held in one of his hands by the straps.

He broke from his surveillance to give her a smile. "I'm glad for this chance
to go shopping for small things like this," he told her. "And I think it's
great that you found something to do in the club that you really seem to
enjoy."

She felt her face warm up slightly and managed a giggle, heading into her
favorite supply store. The clerks looked up as she entered with Kyon in tow,
smiling and waving, but holding their distance. She hadn't come very often,
but the women who worked at the store seemed very friendly, and having only
seen Kyon once before, referred to him as her 'boyfriend'. Probably it was for
the best they were keeping their distance today; she hadn't exactly gone out
of her way to correct them.

"I've enjoyed things we've done with Suzumiya-san," she finally said, looking
back at him with a smile as they reached the cloth she was looking for. "Like
... even though it was very difficult, and I had to learn some new things,
working on the literature club's anthology! And I like the company of
everyone, especially when we don't have something urgent to take care of! And
lately, things seem to be going quite well!"

He gave her an appraising look, and she tried not to blush under his scrutiny,
doing her best to deflect it with a happy smile.

"In a lot of ways, that's true," he admitted, while she began collecting the
bolts of cloth that she needed. "But I still like spending time with you...."
He seemed to hesitate, as though he might have said too much, then shrugged,
not quite meeting her eyes.

After buying everything she thought she would need to make Kanae's next
costume, and a few extra things she was confident she would find a use for
soon, the pair left the shop, Kyon now carrying both of their schoolbags and a
load of sewing supplies. "Um, Kyon-kun," she asked, as they headed through the
market district, "i...it's a bit late, so would you like to have, um, dinner
with me?"

"Would you like me to take you somewhere?" he returned, giving her a small
smile.

She felt her face redden and shook her head minutely. "I wanted to cook,
actually, if that's alright...."

He had already looked happy, but at that he immediately brightened further.
"If it's no trouble," he allowed.

She gave him a hesitant smile, admitting, "I'm still not very used to how the
marketplace here works, so ... would it be alright if I were to ask you for
help with gathering what I'll need?"

"No problem at all," he assured her.

Her smile widened; she couldn't imagine the day getting much better than it
had been so far. Now, all she needed was to gather her ingredients and cook,
then she could see about maybe being a tiny bit naughty and trying to kiss
Kyon again. Or, maybe, if she did a really good job of preparing for dinner,
_he_ would kiss _her_!

Distracted by those thoughts, she almost collided with someone, restrained
only when Kyon's hand circled around her wrist, pulling her back. She squeaked
in alarm, flinching back from the cold glare of the time traveler who called
himself Fujiwara. Her retreat left her to stumble into Kyon for support, who
absently released her wrist and put a reassuring hand on her shoulder, his
gaze fixed on the other boy.

Fujiwara's angry stare went from her to him, and Mikuru thought for the merest
second she saw the hint of horrified realization before his scowl deepened.
"So," he growled, "you've chosen your alliances, I see. Your predetermination
versus my free will, is it?"

"Oh, save it," Kyon retorted in a clipped tone. "I'm not in the mood for all
of this posturing. I know you're not actually trying to hurt us, already, or
you would have tried using the damn weapon you stole last Saturday!" Mikuru
was only able to resist flinching from Kyon's curse by the reassurance she got
from leaning against him.

Fujiwara's glower faded, and he looked pensively thoughtful. "I could have
motives you cannot fathom," he muttered. "You can make assumptions based on my
previously observed behavior, but you can't prove my free will doesn't exist!
However, if you're going to be such an arrogant mercenary, I'll tell you this
much; you can't hurt me right now."

Kyon's feet shifted slightly, though he didn't move, and his hand was still a
reassuring weight on her shoulder. "You say that like I randomly attack
people," he countered. "The only reason I would have to hurt you is if you
tried something stupid. Like whatever you got Sasaki into!"

"Oh, a weak spot?" Fujiwara retorted, crossing his arms over his chest and
raising an eyebrow. "Too bad! It's predetermined that I run into you last
Saturday ... nice to know I'm effectively immortal until then! I think I'll go
back to just before then and do something fun -- maybe invite your friend
along to the beach!" He grinned, shaking his head. "But then, maybe I'll wait
a little while, since every moment between now and then, I'm predetermined to
survive. So, tough guy, what do you have to say to _that_?"

In answer Kyon produced his PDA from his pocket, pointing it at Fujiwara.

The other time traveler looked unimpressed, merely noting, "Unless you want to
try and violate the way that predetermination works, you know that you can't
do anything to me."

Kyon scanned Fujiwara and stored the image. "My PDA right here now has a
perfect image of you in it. I have a pretty good holo-disguise, too. It's not
predetermined that _you_ arrive at the beach last Saturday. Realistically, I
could go back disguised as you; it'd be indistinguishable to the me from back
then, wouldn't it?"

Fujiwara's sneer vanished, and he narrowed his eyes.

"So, self-proclaimed champion of free will," Kyon said dryly, "be free, and
accomplish nothing, or jump through my hoop of predetermination like a good
dog, and maybe you'll get a tool you can use for a while."

"Alright," Fujiwara growled. "Alright!" This last shout was so loud that
Mikuru couldn't help but flinch, and several nearby people turned to look, no
longer pretending not to eavesdrop at the very public -- and to them, cryptic
-- conversation. "I'll accept the mad precept that you tried to sell me
before; _you_, not Asahina Mikuru are the champion of predetermination and the
enemy of free will," he spat sourly. "All of those encounters against her may
have been meaningless, but at your request, until we can settle our dividing
issue, _you_ are my singular foe!"

Done with that declaration, he turned around, marching away through the
quickly parting crowd. Mikuru turned to study Kyon's face; he gave a minuscule
shake of his head to someone in the crowd, then turned and gave her an
apologetic smile. "Sorry about that," he sighed. He grimaced, bowing his head.
"I feel like an idiot, though; I just engineered his involvement in last
Saturday by opening my mouth and assuming. I should have remembered he's a
time traveler too...."

"Y...you aren't worried about making him your enemy?" she asked him in
uncertain surprise.

"If some jerk wants to cause you trouble, then I would gladly be a wall to
block that person's progress," Kyon told her, shrugging.

"T...thank you, Kyon-kun," she breathed, feeling guilty. "Um, but, for what
you said ... I don't think you can blame yourself too much; I have special
training, and I make mistakes, too! And, really, wasn't it predetermined that
Saturday went the way it did? You just made sure it happened as it was
supposed to."

"You're right," he realized, brightening, gesturing her forward towards the
store they had been headed towards. "But if I had kept a cooler head and not
snapped at him, then last Saturday...." He trailed off, considering something.
"Well, I had to make this mistake," he finally decided. "But it's also a good
lesson to me to pay more attention next time."

She wasn't certain what to make of his ideas of challenging
predetermination.... But something about what he had said -- using the
disguise to fill Fujiwara's role without him.... Since predetermination was
set by observation, was it possible to manipulate history, and therefore,
reality, by changing events outside of the observational scope?

Of course, history, and her agency's records, left little question as to what
happened in most cases. How to make a change without causing trouble?

That thought kept her from speaking much, outside of small talk with Kyon,
until after they'd reached her tiny apartment and he was seated at the
kotatsu. While she cooked, he did his homework, giving her some time to
consider the implications. He looked up from his papers, gladly pushing them
all away to make room for the dinner she'd prepared once it had finished.

"This is amazing," he swore after a handful of bites.

"I...it's the best I could make, here," she told him, blushing happily. "Um
... but, I did add some things from outside of the normal recipe...."

The realization hit her so abruptly she nearly tipped over in her seat.
"T...that's it!" she exclaimed suddenly, her eyes wide as she stared at Kyon
in amazement. All she needed to do was add some ingredients to history from
outside of the recipe ... it would avoid violating causality, even if the end
result was more seasoned to her tastes!

"Asahina-san?" Kyon asked her worriedly.

How brilliant was he, to not have had proper training, and yet understand
innately that there really _was_ a loophole to allow a time traveler change
history!? The implications were _staggering_! This would change time travel as
her people understood it! No wonder her superiors had said she was subject to
his orders; if she hadn't given him the freedom to discover that for them....

Mikuru swallowed and shook her head, giving him her brightest smile. "Y...you
don't need to call me that when we're alone, Kyon-kun," she reminded him.

"Um ... Mikuru-chan? Are you oka-- Woah!"

Some small part of her mind told her that aggressively launching herself at
Kyon might have been a bad idea, but he'd caught her and let her momentum bear
them to the floor, so she dismissed it and kissed him excitedly before he
could remark on the same. She didn't care that they were missing dinner; it
would be there for them once she and Kyon stopped kissing, and she could
always heat it up again if she had to.

* * *

Since the meeting had been arranged by her father, Tsuruya had asked Kyon and
Koizumi to meet with her at the school entrance once club activities had let
out. The entire day had been more fun than usual; Tsuruya couldn't get over
the fact that Kyon could change his outfit at will. Not that he tended to.

Luckily, Haruhi couldn't get over it either; they'd spent most of the meeting
trying different anime character costumes on him. He'd accepted random costume
changes without complaint, much to Kanae and Mikuru's barely concealed
delight. On the other hand, he was still dominating everyone at Scrabble by a
ludicrous margin, finally drawing even Haruhi into a game.

Kanae obligingly did her job as the referee, slowly reading out the English
definitions for words she didn't know the meanings of. While it wasn't as one-
sided as the previous matches, Kyon was still the clear winner. Haruhi seemed
incredulous, and managed to narrow the gap, but still not beat Kyon, even when
she finally insisted on a match between just the two of them. When the time
for the meeting came around, Haruhi had immediately swept Kanae into her arms
and rounded on Yuki, insisting that _she_ needed to study and giving Kyon a
warning glare.

The two boys rounded the shoe lockers, Koizumi looking more relaxed than
usual, and Kyon as implacable as he almost always appeared. Tsuruya smiled and
waved at both, before they stepped out of the vestibule and started walking
towards the waiting limousine. She really didn't mind that the esper was going
to be there, but she had to admit that she also really enjoyed stealing
private moments where she could cuddle up to Kyon and maybe kiss....

Koizumi wasn't going to help that mood -- though, to be honest, her father's
presence was a bigger concern. And that probably meant that she should really
focus on the task at hand.

Kasai, already standing outside the vehicle, inclined his head and opened a
door. The three climbed into the back seat of the car together, Tsuruya
sitting between Kyon and Koizumi. The bodyguard and driver closed the door and
walked around the car, climbing into the front as the engine started up.

Opposite Tsuruya was her father, sitting facing her and Kyon, but brooding
over what his assistant Aida was showing him on his almost eternally present
PDA. Tsuruya glanced at Kyon, not really surprised at the way he glanced at
the device, as though comparing it to his own, but smirked at him anyway. He
caught her glance and looked the slightest bit guilty before shrugging.

Next to Aida, sharing the long bench-like seat, was Mori dressed sharply in
her usual business wear, though Tsuruya was glad to see that she too now
sported the family pin. The vehicle smoothly pulled into motion and Tsuruya's
father grunted, Aida stowing his PDA and bowing his head apologetically.

Still in a distracted funk, the Tsuruya family patriarch pulled a cigar from
within his coat, absently clipping one end before fumbling for his lighter.
Even then, he was completely absorbed in his heating ritual, turning the tip
of the cigar over above the flame until it heated evenly, concluding by taking
a long draw. It was only then that he seemed to realize he wasn't alone in the
car. Tsuruya shoved down a tiny surge of worry; her father didn't usually get
distracted like this unless something had gone very wrong.

He thumbed a button from the cubby at his side, rolling the window nearest to
him down a short distance and expelling a long plume of smoke towards it.
Vents steered the vast majority of the smoke away, through the gap, and he
settled his eyes on Kyon, nodding. He gestured with the smoking brand towards
the woman past Aida. "Mori-chan?" he rumbled.

"Yes, well," she said, nodding as she turned her attention to the youths in
the back of the vehicle. "Tsuruya-sama has been monitoring our reports on
Sumiyoshi-rengo activity in town lately. Over the course of the last two days,
we've tracked about a dozen of their known men moving into the city, and now
we know why." She paused, turning her dark eyes across the three.

"I'm not up to date on the latest of the Tsuruya-gumi's actions, but I do have
a suspicion, here," Koizumi remarked, crossing his arms over his chest
thoughtfully. "Considering that we suspect some NPA hand of moving chess
pieces from behind the scenes, so to speak.... Well, as we've heard from the
Tamaru brothers, they unintentionally allowed one suspect to coerce a lead on
the case involving Kyon's shooting."

"That's right," Mori agreed. She produced a folded newspaper from a cubby at
her side and unfolded it enough to reveal the headline. "'Hundreds of firearms
seized in secret NPA raid'," she quoted. "This was released to the presses
this morning, but it seems the actual raid happened some time yesterday."

"Aah," Tsuruya realized, grimacing and shaking her head. "Sos, now the entire
Sumiyoshi-rengo is hurtings, not just the Fujiya-tachi. And they're itchings
for revenge against whoever they blames?"

"That's the speculation," her father agreed, nodding.

Kyon leaned forward a short distance, frowning. "I'm not sure I get
everything," he began apologetically, "but do I understand that someone is
trying to pick a fight between us? I mean, with the Sumiyoshi-rengo and the
Tsuruya-tachi?"

Tsuruya couldn't help but grin at how comfortably Kyon included himself in the
group. Her father seemed to take it in stride, just nodding in answer.

"Well, chess master," Koizumi prompted, turning to look at Kyon, "what
strategy do you suggest?"

"Information is power," Kyon answered without hesitation. "In go, chess, shogi
-- it doesn't really matter -- in all of those games, you can see the entire
board. Here, this is maybe in places like chess, and in other places more like
poker -- we can't see the other guy's hand, so we don't know what cards they
bring, or what strategy they're pursuing. If I were like Nagato I might be
able to figure it out, but I'm not."

"No plan, then?" Koizumi asked, his smile fading.

"I didn't say that," Kyon countered. "I'd like to collect more information
without revealing too much of our own hand to the enemy. Any move I made right
now would be to play dumb; don't betray anything by acting rashly." He frowned
and shook his head. "But the rules of this game.... Hell, right now, we don't
even know who one of the players is."

Tsuruya nodded in sympathy; her father was only peripherally aware of the
other things Kyon was weighing. Koizumi's jokes aside, the board was a lot
bigger than he could probably handle alone. Luckily, it was a team game; she
knew she wasn't ready to grasp a lot of the details of the current situation
herself. But she could handle quite a bit.

In fact, that had been her eventual responsibility. While she was going to be
the next family head, her father had good decades of life left, at least. She
didn't intend to sit by idly and wait to inherit, and she could advise Kyon on
how to handle the ninkyo dantai aspects in the meantime. "Oh, politics," she
sighed, smiling. "Usually, to avoid bloodshed in this situations, we would
sends someone to meet with the Sumiyoshi-rengo and discuss what happened. With
luck, we could explains things peacefully."

Her father nodded and puffed on his cigar again. "The Sumiyoshi-rengo have
lost thirty eight men from their forces, including the oyabun of three
separate groups in that NPA raid," he intoned gravely.

Tsuruya swallowed uncomfortably at that. Aida glanced at the man in mild
surprise before shrugging, adding, "In terms of holdings, they lost a major
smuggling operation -- and nearly forty billion yen in seized vehicles,
property, and contraband."

Mori contributed, "On the organizational front, it was a perfect storm of NPA
activity. The information got to the NPA in the nick of time for them to stage
a last-moment raid. Moreover, for the Sumiyoshi-rengo, an additional high-
profile group was involved in this particular smuggling operation. Despite not
having their customary time to train for the encounter, the SAT team -- under
NPA supervision -- suffered no fatalities in the raid."

"A stinging loss, a major insult, and significant financial damage," Tsuruya's
father concluded. "So. I'm leery of sending a messenger over."

Kyon frowned. "Okay, so they're angry; what can we do to keep ourselves safe?"
he asked. "Until we know what's going on, at least."

"If it's not out of place for me to make this observation," Mori began
hesitantly, shifting her gaze to the Tsuruya family head, one fingertip rising
to trace across the pin on her coat, "I felt that Fujiya Masao was honest when
he wished for peace."

"I thought so too, though," Kyon noted, shrugging glumly.

Tsuruya's father raised his eyebrows, nodding before he took a long draw from
his brand, expelling it slowly. "What we really need," he said, chewing
absently on his cigar, "is a way to speak to Masao. It's entirely possible at
this point that he's not connected with the Sumiyoshi-rengo. So, as angry as
the newcomers in town may be, it's possible it's not with us, as much as them.
Either way, for the cost to pride, I wouldn't be surprised if we made more
viable targets than the NPA, and they need a show of strength for morale."

"What, you mean recruiting him?" Tsuruya asked, startled.

"Not likely," her father countered, shaking his head with a mild smirk. "But
an alliance; it would be best if they could somehow survive, and continue to
be the convenient distraction they were."

"First things first," Kyon put in. "If we want to talk to Masao, I can do
that."

Her father's eyebrows rose as he studied Kyon. "You think so?" he mused.

"I got in before; I talked to Jun -- one of the guys who shot me," he
confirmed, nodding.

Tsuruya took a deep breath, shaking her head in admiration. Well, she wasn't
going to be left behind, anyway. "Good thinking," she encouraged him. In the
meantime ... she would have to talk to Haruhi about setting up a meeting with
the Sumiyoshi-rengo anyway. If they needed more information, she wasn't about
to neglect a source. And she was positive that with some help from Yuki, they
could even do it safely.

"Alright," her father allowed, studying Kyon curiously. "Tomorrow, then, if
you still want to do that, Kyon-kun.... But be careful."

"Yes," Tsuruya agreed, turning to face her fiance and realizing there wasn't
enough traffic to give her the time she really wanted before they would part
ways. "Haru-nyan and Nagato-chi will be furious with me if you get dinged up!"

"I'll be careful," he agreed, quirking his lips in a smile. "Besides," he
added, jerking a thumb at Koizumi, "if things get really bad, my personal
assistant can bail me out." After looking mildly surprised for a moment,
Koizumi smiled and nodded, spreading his hands in a 'what can you do?'
gesture.

"Goods, goods," her father sighed, stubbing out his cigar, his smile widening.
"I'm glad that my daughters attracts competent people to her!"

Tsuruya giggled into her sleeve, thinking he didn't know the half of it.

After meeting up with Miyoko for most of the walk home, Nonoko was delighted
to see her brother waiting at the gates. "Kyon-kun!" she chirped, launching
into a tackling hug, which he caught her in effortlessly.

"Kyon-nii-san!" Miyoko called out, waving with her free hand before stooping
to collect Nonoko's dropped bag. "You're out of your club early today?"

"Yeah, I have a mission today," he agreed. "So I had to come home early." He
took Nonoko's bag from Miyoko, admonishing, "Imouto, you didn't thank Miyoko-
chan properly for picking up your bag. You should carry it yourself."

Nonoko pouted at her brother. "Okay," she grumbled, accepting her bag before
she brightened. "What's your mission?"

"You won't be in any danger, will you?" Miyoko asked worriedly.

"You know, I can honestly say it's nothing I've never done before?" he
remarked, grinning. "I have to go speak to someone who's very difficult to get
to."

She could imagine it easily; he was probably breaking into a military base --
or a high security prison. Somewhere that some unsuspecting mortals had
managed to restrain a dark general, or just kept one who had decided to stop
following their evil ways. In any case, her brother would have to watch out.
"If you've done it before in the same place, then you should watch out for
government secret agents," she warned him in a hushed voice, covering her hand
with her mouth, just in case there were any spies around. "They mean well, but
they don't understand your job!"

He nodded thoughtfully at that. "It's amazing, but I have almost no fear for
your ability to survive in the world, Imouto. Somehow, you're starting to act
so much like Haruhi did when I first met her, I'm confident you'll be
invincible."

"I just need my magical girl powerup!" Nonoko exclaimed cheerfully. "I _know_
it will come some day!"

"With Shamisen as your magical spirit guide?" Miyoko asked, giggling.

She considered that; it was a good question. "No," she decided after a moment.
"I think I want a pixie, or a fairy. And, anyway, Shami is a boy cat!"

Kyon and Miyoko laughed together at that. "Well, if you ever need help
fighting dark generals of your own, let me know," Kyon told her. "I'll help
you out."

"Silly," she chided her brother. "Boys are super-easy to mind-control! I don't
want to have to fight you, too."

"Darn, I guess I'd better stick to my own genres," he sighed, shaking his
head. "Speaking of which," he added, as they reached the corner where Miyoko
would split away, "Tsuruya-kun got tickets for both of you; will you be able
to come to see the movie tomorrow, Miyoko-chan? I'm not sure Imouto remembered
to tell you that you were invited."

She felt her face redden as Miyoko's eyes widened. "O...oh, okay!" she said
cheerfully. "Right! I'm sure it will be fine with my parents -- will Haru-nee
and Mikuru-nee be there?" She swallowed, looking bashfully away for some
reason. "O...or ... Koizumi-san?"

He shook his head slightly in negation as they stopped, quirking one eyebrow
higher. "Um ... no, Tsuruya-kun and Kanae-chan. I have a feeling I'm going to
end up taking everyone else to see it later, though."

Miyoko's excitement diminished slightly, but she nodded. "Okay, well, it would
be nice to see a movie with you that went, um, well.... So, yes, okay! We'll
meet tomorrow?"

"Sure, just walk home with Imouto. Tsuruya-kun said she would come by to pick
us up after gathering Kanae-chan," he agreed.

The other girl nodded excitedly, then waved goodbye and skipped away, humming.
"I think," Nonoko said slowly, frowning, "that Miyoko-chan has a crush on
Koizumi-kun!"

"That may be," her brother allowed, resuming the walk home.

"But he's so boring," she mused. "I wonder why she likes him?"

Kyon blinked, then looked at her sidelong. "I'm not sure I want to touch this
one," he answered, after a long, thoughtful pause. "This is starting to be the
line of discussion I'd rather inflict on Mom."

"What's that mean?"

"Mom's the expert in this stuff," he clarified. "You should ask her."

"Okay!" she decided, as he opened the door. Their mother was inside in the
kitchen, calling out a greeting after they announced themselves in practiced
tandem. "Mom! Oh, guess what they announced at school today?" She hopped out
of her outdoor shoes and landed in her slippers, bouncing again up the short
step into the house proper, out of the entryway. In the hall, she skipped from
one foot to the other excitedly, rifling through her bag before pulling out
the permission slip she had been given earlier. She slid to a halt before she
lost her balance, halfway down the hall.

"What, do you need a signature to attend a certain class?" their mother asked,
mildly intrigued as she walked out of the kitchen, wiping her hands with a
small hand-towel.

"Better!" she crowed, as her brother more sedately slipped off his shoes and
put on his slippers, incidentally picking her own shoes up before her mother
noted. She belatedly realized that she was getting too excited ... no reason
to jeopardize this, after all. Settling down, she held the paper out to her
mother like an offering. "Field trip!"

"They're doing field trips in elementary school now?" Kyon asked, intrigued.
"Is it to a library or hospital? Something like that?"

"No~ope~!" she cheered, grinning and shaking her head. "We're going to
Gokoko.... Uh, it's Gukuku...." She stifled a gasp of despair. Her magical-
girl trip depended on this! How could she not remember how to pronounce where
she was going?"

"Gokoku-ji," her mother said, reading from the paper. "Hmm, that sounds
familiar...."

"It's the name of a temple," her brother said authoritatively. She remembered
the same thing being mentioned by the friendly, unfamiliar teacher that had
joined the roster, sharing the opening minutes of class with her usual home-
room teacher. "It's located in--"

Her mother abruptly snapped the paper down, looking sharply up at Kyon. "You
had tests back today, didn't you?"

"I got a ninety eight in math, and a perfect score for grammar," he answered,
reaching into his coat and pulling out two folded sheets of paper. "Oh, I also
promised that I was going to go out and do errands for Tsuruya-kun. I might
not be back until late."

Nonoko shifted from foot to foot in agitation as her mother was distracted
from the all-important field-trip form to glance at Kyon in surprise. "Is that
so?" she asked, impressed. "Well, then, by all means!"

"Mo~om!" Nonoko whined. "My permission slip!" It was all well and good that
Kyon's career was working out, but she deserved to go on this field-trip. Kyon
had gotten to go on an amazing island adventure, after all, and she'd been
left out, despite her best efforts. This was her chance to go somewhere remote
and special, where she would have her once-in-a-life-time encounter that would
give her the much-needed magical-girl powerup!

"I'm not sure about this," her mother said doubtfully, while her brother took
advantage of the opportunity to slip away upstairs. "Really, three days ...
and that fee...."

Nonoko bit her lip, thinking of something else the pretty young teacher had
mentioned. "The trip coordinator mentioned that they're looking for additional
parent chaperones," she volunteered. "They would get to join the trip at the
same rate!"

Time outside of the hallway should have stopped by all rights due to the
gravity of the situation, but surprisingly quickly, her brother trotted back
down the stairs, dressed in a very sharp dark blue suit, adjusting his cuffs
as he reached the hallway. A pair of dress shoes dangled from his fingertips
as he stepped around her, disrupting the quiet moment.

"Where will you be going?" her mother pressed Kyon, looking away from the
paperwork again.

"Well," he began, before the house's doorbell rang. He shrugged sheepishly and
went to the entryway, opening the door. Tsuruya stood outside in a formal
kimono, waving one hand and grinning as cheerfully as ever. "Hello, Tsuruya-
kun," he greeted her, stepping out of his slippers and tugging on his shoes.
"My mom was just asking what we'd be doing tonight."

"Oh, well, Kyon-kun here is working for my father part-times, just like I am,"
Tsuruya explained with a giggle. Her eyes drifted from Nonoko's mother to the
small girl, and she blinked, her smile fading slightly. "Imouto-kun? What's
wrong?"

Nonoko could have sniffled, if she weren't braver; trust Tsuruya, reliable as
always, to notice her distress. She launched herself at the taller girl,
glomping onto her in a hug. "I want to go on a field trip!" she cried. "But I
don't think we can!"

Tsuruya caught her easily, giggling and twirling. "Silly Imouto-kun!" she
chirped. "It's not decided yets, is it?"

"No," she admitted ... though, realistically, her mother seldom changed her
mind once she seemed even slightly opposed to something.

"This is about that field trip?" Kyon asked, running one hand through his
hair. "Imouto...."

"I didn't rule it out absolutely," her mother said, suddenly contrite, putting
her hands on her her hips. "Nonoko, you should be better behaved! Especially
around your brother's fiancee!"

"She's fine, she's fine!" Tsuruya insisted, setting her down back inside the
doorway of her house. "I like to see Imouto-kun's smiles!"

"Then, I can go on the trip?" she asked, looking at her mother hopefully.

She sighed, looking pained. "Nonoko...."

"Is there anythings I can do to help?" Tsuruya asked earnestly.

"Ah, n...no," her mother relented, "it's in hand ... fine, alright, we'll go,
Nonoko, but I expect you to keep your grades where they're at! If you slip,
it's off!"

"Yes!" she exalted, cheering. "I will, I promise!"

"Alrighty, then," Tsuruya said brightly, waving, "we'll be back later; gots to
make up for lost time!" She linked her arm through Kyon's and dashed to the
waiting limousine.

"Thank you, Mom!" Nonoko cheered, scrambling up the stairs to her room to
finish her homework before her mother could change her mind.

* * *

After reviewing a map of the compound, pointing out the route that he and Yuki
had taken to the cells, Kyon had gotten dropped off at a train station a few
miles away. Slipping into a restroom stall, he changed his outfit to match a
salary-man he had scanned earlier with his PDA. He thumbed through a few
options and improved the illusion so that his face and body would appear to
match the same man, then stepped out and ambled through the throng of people
in the station to the waiting traffic circle.

Fifteen minutes later, he had gotten himself on a taxi headed towards the
station -- and a sizable traffic jam. Three blocks from his target, he told
his driver he'd just get out and walk, tipping the unsurprised man what he
hoped was a standard sum.

Near the station, he checked the PDA's power monitor, which tracked the
reserves of all his tools. Conveniently, they shared their energy, so the
greatcoat had no trouble maintaining the image. The power usage didn't change
noticeably when he ducked into an alley and became completely invisible. Alone
and unseen, he paused, taking stock of himself and considering what he was
doing.

This wasn't much crazier than anything else he had done before, save that he'd
decided to try and avoid bothering Yuki, for a change. And, he admitted to
himself, this had become a much more personal issue than some of the other
things he'd dealt with. Deciding he'd wasted enough time already, he double-
timed it out of the alley and down the street, slowing to a quick walk as he
slipped through behind a pair of policemen returning to the station.

The wide doorways slid shut behind the officers, and he consulted his mental
map, turning to a long hallway and marching down its empty, quiet length.
Attached rooms betrayed undecipherable buzzes of conversation, or occasionally
nothing at all. As he approached the end of the hallway, where a pair of
double-doors stood, he froze, flinching as another nearby side-door abruptly
clicked open.

A woman in a dark brown skirt and coat backed out of the door, carrying a
clipboard with a small sheaf of papers attached, and then tugged it shut
behind her. She glanced both ways down the deserted hall, then strode
purposefully directly towards Kyon.

He hopped away, muffling a belated curse as he realized she wasn't charging
him, merely heading swiftly towards the double-doors. He stepped behind her,
following her closely enough to slip through when she paused and fished a card
from her coat pocket, passing it over a reader and causing the door to unlock
with a loud click and a resounding buzz.

The room beyond was the same one Yuki had brought him to, once before. He saw
the door they had used, then, and watched the woman he had followed as she
approached a desk and rapped her knuckles on it. The white-haired man behind
the desk glanced up from a bank of security monitors and smiled politely.
"Akasaka-dono," he greeted the woman, inclining his head to her. "Is there
something I can help you with?"

She nodded back, handing over the clipboard. "I need these forms to be
signed," she explained, "concerning interviews with our current captives --
based on the recent arrests in Osaka."

While Kyon didn't particularly care for their small-talk, he was stuck in the
room until someone else opened a door -- a serious oversight. He mentally
berated himself; Yuki wouldn't have made a careless mistake like that. And, he
pondered, he had no way to deal with a locked door, either. Pulling his PDA
from his pocket, he made a reminder for what he needed to learn that night.

In the meantime, his mission hadn't been a total failure yet. The doors to the
cell-block opened, an unfamiliar pair of detectives and a uniformed officer
striding together. "We'll get back to the interview in about an hour," one of
the detectives said, rolling his head, one hand on the back of his neck. "But,
man, talk about tight-lipped."

Kyon slipped through the doorway again as the detectives began to discuss
where to get their mid-shift meal. While his PDA was in his hand, he also
added a timer for when he could expect the detectives to be back to open the
door again. Pocketing the device, he slipped down the hallway into the cell-
block and then stopped before yet another locked door.

He turned around just in time to watch the entrance door slam shut. Okay, he
thought to himself. First solo mission progress ... less than optimal.

Since he had nothing better to do, he studied the corridor he was in. A pair
of empty holding cells were on either side, their bars forming walls, with
another secured steel door, locked, but with a keyhole. Glancing around
revealed a video camera, so forcing the door was out of the question ... but
probably picking the lock would have been, too.

The air duct was heavily barred, but very tiny. There were just four of them
in a row atop the overhanging concrete wall. Kyon gauged that he probably
wouldn't fit through the vents, even if he did remove the grate. It did look
like they might be out of view of the camera, at least.

Muffling a sigh, he sat down on the floor and pulled out his PDA. Still plenty
of power, so.... He realized in a worse case scenario, he could just follow
the detectives. Unless they happened to be planning on talking with Masao, at
least. According to the clock, he had only to wait forty more minutes.

He flipped to his notebook and had the PDA turn his training note into a wish-
list, adding 'spy skills', and filling in a list of things he'd probably need
to know. Some way to get around cameras with regards to doors, at the very
least. Probably something to hack computers ... retrospectively, he'd gotten
lucky on that count the first time he'd helped Tsuruya fight off the
Sumiyoshi-rengo.

After compiling enough items to become bored, he flipped through the menus and
played chess, beating the AI soundly twice. He was debating a third game when
the application quit, spontaneously loading minesweeper instead. He eyed the
field of potential digital explosions, leaning slightly away from his own PDA.

Taking a hint, he pocketed the device and checked the time on his watch. The
second hand slowly ticked away. Another two minutes passed before the doors to
the lobby abruptly slammed open, and he hopped to his feet. The two uniformed
officers came down the hall, evidently in the middle of an animated
discussion.

"Every time, though," the first officer grumbled, holding the door open, one
hand adjusting his hat over his short gray hair. "It's been at least three
times now, right?"

"I'm not saying you don't get sick every time we go there," the younger
officer with him commented, his own hat tucked in the crook of his arm. He
stepped through the doorway into the corridor with Kyon, looking back over his
shoulder and asking, "But why do you always order the same thing? None of us
get the--"

"Officers," the woman that Kyon had followed earlier snapped, visible in the
lobby that Kyon had last seen her in. "If I can just ask you to focus on the
task at hand? You _are_ escorting dangerous men from solitary back to their
holding cells, aren't you?"

"Hey," the younger officer began, scowling as he turned, ready to march back
into the lobby, before he was suddenly cut off. The older officer placed a
palm on the other man's chest, shoving him backward and out of the woman's
line of sight.

"Yes, Akasaka-san," the older man agreed, bowing as he hurriedly backed into
the corridor. "We're all business through these doors."

The bareheaded officer scowled, tugging his hat on properly. "Takahara, I
don't see why I can't just tell that NPA bi--"

"Enough, Toji!" the older officer barked at his young colleague. "Don't piss
her off, and don't badmouth her -- that's what we call a career limiting move.
You want a promotion? Behave yourself!"

Stung, Toji recoiled from the other officer. Kyon shifted his shoulders
uncomfortably at being made an unintentional eavesdropper, and waited for
Takahara to fish a large keyring from his belt and unlock the inner door.
"So," the young man said in a subdued voice, "we're moving Fujiya, first?"

"That's right," Takahara agreed. He opened the door and slipped through, Kyon
following immediately, and Toji a moment later. He followed the pair through a
number of security doors before they finally opened what had looked to Kyon
like an armored closet door. He realized it was Fujiya's solitary confinement
cell as the still-proud Yakuza tottered out, standing stiffly and presenting
his wrists to be handcuffed, staring challengingly at Toji.

For his relative youth, the officer was unfazed, cuffing him swiftly and then
leading him down the hall as his partner closed the cell, then moved ahead to
the cell block. "Watanabe gets out too?" the man rasped, raising an eyebrow in
challenge.

"Yeah, your good friend is being transferred as soon as he gets out of
medical."

"Where?"

Toji snorted in response, rolling his eyes. Kyon followed the group in silence
until they reached a cell-block, almost every cell filled with the somewhat
familiar members of Fujiya's gang. After the small-time gang leader was locked
in his cell and unbound, the older man said, "Now, enjoy yourself, but not as
much as last time, alright?"

"I want to talk to my lawyer," Fujiya grated in response, tottering to his
cell's small sink, filling his cup and drinking thirstily.

"Yeah, yeah, I'll put out the word," the officer said dryly. "But don't hold
your breath for a miracle at this hour -- I doubt your defender is as devoted
as Odoroki Hosuke."

Fujiya merely filled his cup and drank again, ignoring the officers as they
walked away. Kyon pursed his lips thoughtfully and glanced around, realizing
that at least half a dozen other men could see where he was standing from
their cells. He nervously checked his PDA, but the power was still fine. Now,
he hadn't thought this part through, either. How to talk to the man without
causing a huge ruckus?

He went to the cell door, looking around. The men in the adjacent cells were
quietly complacent, while the man directly across softly played a harmonica --
or tried to. Leaning close to the bars, Kyon cupped a hand to his mouth and
whispered, "Hey!"

Fujiya grunted in response after his third cup of water, turning around and
glancing at his surroundings blearily. Seeing nothing, he filled his cup a
fourth time.

"Hey!" Kyon whispered again, slightly more loudly. "Fujiya-san!"

The man jerked slightly, but finished drinking his cup before turning around,
hesitantly ambling towards the cell door. "Where are you?" he mumbled, casting
about.

"Outside your cell," Kyon answered very quietly.

The man nodded slightly, and the harmonica player abruptly cut off. "Sorry,
Boss," he said, apologetically. "Didn't mean to bother you."

"No," Fujiya answered, shaking his head and leaning against his door. "Play
it. Louder, even."

"Y...you like 'Never Did No Ramblin'?" the player asked in surprise, naming
the song in English.

"Yeah, sure."

"Do you prefer the Folksmen version, or the way the New--"

"Just play it," Fujiya growled.

"Uh ... okay, right." The warbling harmonica began again, louder this time,
and Fujiya mumbled, "Kowa-Keigo Kyon, eh? So you really do have mystic
powers."

"Something like that," Kyon allowed, just as quietly. "I'm here as a
representative of the Tsuruya branch of the Yamaguchi-gumi."

"Damn, your branch is something else, sending a messenger in here," Fujiya
mumbled dubiously. "Well, what's the deal, then? I'm guessing that more
Sumiyoshi-rengo are showing up throughout town?"

"That's right," Kyon agreed, quickly outlining the facts of the raid and what
they knew of recent Sumiyoshi-rengo losses. Fujiya looked at first unsettled,
then disgusted, until he finished.

"This is still all actually Watanabe's fault," Fujiya sighed. "Not that it
matters; none of the Sumiyoshi-rengo have spoken to us, except through the
lawyers they've sent over."

"However that works out," Kyon replied, shrugging. "There's a strong suspicion
that the folks in town these days may not be your friends...."

"Well, you can call that suspicion a fact," Fujiya confirmed, shaking his head
and leaning it against the bars of his cell. "Now, what else did you come here
for?"

After a breath to settle himself, Kyon said, "While we can't go through the
formality here, I've been asked to extend what may be a mutually beneficial
offer."

"You're recruiting us to join the Tsuruya-tachi?" Fujiya asked sourly.

"No," Kyon replied quickly, shaking his head before he realized the man
couldn't see it. The harmonica player hit a high note and coughed, apologizing
before he restarted the song again. "We're recruiting you to join the
Yamaguchi-gumi."

Fujiya's lips curled in a smile and he nodded slowly, understanding. "Well,
then," he mumbled, smirking, "you want an alliance? I'm about to need a new
lawyer."

Kyon remembered not to nod. "I'll see what I can do," he agreed.

"If you can, take this," Fujiya murmured, glancing around anxiously and
producing a flattened piece of origami through the bars of his cell. Kyon took
it, though he could tell by the way the other man's eyes stopped tracking it
that it vanished inside his greatcoat. "We're being played. Keep your eyes
open, youngster."

Kyon blinked in surprise at that as the officers returned to the corridor. "No
dice, Fujiya, your lawyer says you fired him," Toji called, shrugging. "You
can start looking for a new one in the morning."

Shaking his head to himself, Kyon followed the officers out of the cell block.

The woman from earlier was still there, speaking of something to the older
officer behind the desk. Remembering that the officers had mentioned she
worked for the NPA, he absently took his PDA from his pocket, raising it to
snap a picture of her with a digitized shutter click.

She abruptly looked up, scanning through the space he occupied, and he
realized that for whatever reason, the sound had been audible. No one else
seemed to have heard; the woman -- Akasaka, the man had called her -- studied
the two officers Kyon had followed briefly, frowning, then shook her head and
turned back to the desk.

Deciding he'd pushed his luck more than far enough, Kyon swiftly followed the
two officers back to the building's public lobby, slipping through the door as
the detectives he'd seen earlier returned, and his PDA chimed a soft reminder.

He scowled, fumbling for the device and shutting off the alarm, but no one
else noted. It wasn't until he was outside, his heart hammering wildly that he
remembered that all cell phones and cameras were required by law to make a
sound, ostensibly to make things harder for voyeurs. Not that this had slowed
Jun and his gang down much -- had Yuki just been making a device that adhered
to the laws, or was that another of her ideas of a joke?

Shaking his head, he pocketed the PDA again, grateful for the chance to bound
out of the building and move around more freely. Alone in the cool dark air,
he found a series of warehouse roofs and when they ran out, he engaged in a
gleeful bout of roof-hopping, all the way back to Tsuruya's place.
