* * *

Tsuruya was sipping tea quietly near her father in one of the sitting rooms in
her house -- the ancestral Tsuruya home. Koizumi sat at the same table next to
Mori, his phone sitting on the table near his teacup, not ringing. Tsuruya's
father nodded thoughtfully at something on one of the stacks of papers before
him, then made a note and shuffled it to one side.

Aida paced softly in the back of the room, quietly punching things into his
PDA and looking distracted -- but he stopped and was the first one to notice
Kyon's return. The boy stepped in from the door leading to the porch, and
Tsuruya instantly perked up. She had every faith in Kyon, but somehow, that
didn't keep her from worrying.

Her fiance was walking next to Shinobu, looking at her slightly askance, his
shoes dangling from the fingertips of one hand. Tsuruya's maid took Kyon's
shoes before he could protest, then gently motioned him into the room
properly.

He shrugged and stepped over the threshold, bowing politely to Tsuruya's
father as the man turned to look. For her part, Tsuruya eagerly bounced up
from her seat on the floor to traipse to Kyon's side and give him a kiss on
the cheek. Though he colored, Kyon didn't remark or complain, and Tsuruya made
a note to herself to make sure that she got to spend at least a few minutes
alone with Kyon some point soon.

Well, maybe with Kanae, too.... Hmm, that might end up being awkward, though.
She filed that thought away for later consideration.

"I'm back," he said, managing a nervously happy smile for Tsuruya, and a more
neutral nod for everyone else.

"Excellent!" the Tsuruya family patriarch crowed, grinning widely, gesturing
Kyon to take a seat. "How did it go, then?"

Mori and Koizumi also watched expectantly, though they remained silent. Kyon
took a seat at the side of the table nearer to Koizumi, and Tsuruya
unhesitantly took the space directly at his side. Her father raised one
eyebrow a fraction of an inch, then just scooted over, not particularly
minding having one entire side of the table to himself. "It ended up taking
longer than I originally planned, but I was able to reach Fujiya Masao-san,"
Kyon answered, bowing his head and giving Tsuruya another of his smiles when
she poured him some tea.

She felt momentarily sad that she couldn't actually prepare tea very well, and
that Shinobu had made the drink for everyone. Maybe she could learn? She
dismissed the thought almost instantly, crushing it with cheer. So what if she
couldn't make tea outside of the tea ceremony, or cook at all? She was a
ninkyo dantai heiress, and she could do other things for Kyon. Why try and
edge in on one of Mikuru's sources of pride?

"And?" her father prompted, while Mori picked up her teacup in both hands, not
sipping it, but only holding the beverage.

Setting his own cup down, Kyon straightened slightly, pulling a flattened,
somewhat crumpled origami flower from within his coat. "Fujiya-san said that
he has broken ties with the Sumiyoshi-rengo, and is considering the offer to
join the Yamaguchi-gumi," he answered. "He also mentioned that he thinks
there's someone behind the scenes trying to pull strings, too, and that this
note may be from that person."

Aida was at the table instantly, seating himself from his anxious pacing
opposite Kyon and looking at the paper with undisguised interest. Tsuruya's
father gave no indication that he noticed, just picking up the paper and
turning it over, examining it closely. "Tawny daylily," he determined after a
moment, not trying to straighten it out or unfold it. He then handed the paper
across the table to Mori, who accepted it curiously, unfolding the paper
carefully and spreading it across the table.

Aida glanced quickly between his PDA and the picture, frowning intently.
"Interesting," Mori remarked.

"'The NPA are chasing the gun; if Watanabe talks, you can walk'," Koizumi
quoted. "Would it seem accurate to infer that this is the note that set our
current bout of issues with the Sumiyoshi-rengo into motion?"

"I would guess so," Aida agreed, looking up.

"This was hand-painted," Tsuruya remarked, studying the characters.

"No pen or printer," Mori agreed. "If it were printed, there might be a chance
of tracking it to the source. If it were written with a pen, it might have
left an impression somewhere. While it's possible that whoever wrote this was
trying to appeal to classical sensibilities, my speculation is that the writer
was merely trying to avoid being traced."

"A caligraphy kit seems somehow more notable than a printer or a pen," Aida
opined, frowning thoughtfully. "But I suppose a brush, inkstone, and paper can
be hidden easily enough.... Well, what else would you guess?"

"I think the writers is a woman," Tsuruya added, noting the incredible
neatness of the text -- there were no stray drops of ink, and the brush was
meticulously groomed. No stray hairs had trailed extraneous tiny marks across
any of the writing.

"I think you're right," Kyon replied, producing his own PDA and flipping
through some options before handing it to Tsuruya. She blinked, looking at a
picture of a woman in a smart, if somewhat drab, brown business coat and skirt
combination, her hair neatly styled as she turned, mid-word, to look towards
the camera. "Her family name is Akasaka; I don't know her given name."

"For some reasons, that sounds very familiar," Tsuruya's father murmured, as
she handed the PDA to him to examine her picture. After a moment of study, he
passed it to Aida, shaking his head. "She doesn't looks familiar, though."

Aida studied the picture intently, until Kyon's PDA made a quiet, muted buzz,
and changed images to a dark screen that Tsuruya couldn't make out from across
the table. Somewhat chagrined, the man passed it back, saying, "My apologies,
Kyon-dono."

Tsuruya realized with some amusement that the PDA had locked itself, until
Kyon touched it and pressed a fingertip against the screen. "It probably just
caught your fingerprint," Kyon explained, shrugging. "If it doesn't match....
Did you want a copy of that picture?"

"If you don't mind," Aida agreed, nodding, tapping some keys on his own PDA.
"By the way, what model is that...?"

"It's, uh ... custom," Kyon answered, shrugging. "Where should I send the
picture?"

After a brief minute of technical chatter, Aida had the picture and excused
himself with a bow, promising to return after he submitted a few queries.

"Impressive, though," Tsuruya's father remarked after a minute, draining his
teacup. "How did you manages to get that picture?"

"Ah, well ... you know, if you do it right, people kind of just look right
through you," Kyon answered, somewhat evasive as he chuckled nervously.

"I've learned it's better not to ask," Mori said quietly, when Tsuruya's
father looked intrigued. "Sir, may I see that picture?"

Kyon nodded, handing the phone over for her to study. "She could be the one
who's pulling the strings, or she could just be an NPA agent working on
anything else," he warned apologetically.

"She's not familiar to me in any case," Mori sighed, shaking her head. "Well,
at least I'll know who she is if I see her."

Accepting the PDA as Mori handed it back, Kyon shrugged slightly. "Anyway,
back to Fujiya Masao-san -- he mentioned that he was going to need a new
lawyer," he said, tucking the device into his coat pocket and turning to face
Tsuruya's father.

The green-haired man raised his eyebrows, his smile returning. "Good," he
decided. "We have many lawyers at our disposals; I will try to arrange for the
best ones!"

Tsuruya looked for something to add, but couldn't find anything else at the
moment, so glanced at Mori -- incidentally leaning against Kyon a tiny bit. He
maintained his posture, his eyes flicking briefly to hers as he gave her a
tiny a smile, otherwise still facing her father. Well, Kyon had just done the
syndicate at large a huge favor, and helped fortify their positions.

"Right," he continued, furrowing his brow and giving Kyon a calculating look,
his smile fading slightly. "Kyon-kun, to be honests, I'm quite amazed at your
capabilities, here." He tapped the unfolded origami with a fingertip. "And
it's thanks to you that our organizations has had Mori-chan's help in some
recent matters."

Koizumi shifted slightly, putting on his implacable, smiling mask in the face
of the man's speech. Mori looked uncertain, but Kyon remained politely
attentive.

"That being said," the man said, lacing his fingers together on the table
before him, completely enveloping his teacup in his hands. "I have every faith
that you can works effectively as your own syndicate for a while."

Mori blinked in surprise, a pleased smile coming to her lips. Koizumi nodded
thoughtfully, while Kyon looked to Tsuruya, who tried to keep her laughter in
check, but let a wide grin blossom. "Who's the boss?" she asked her father,
expecting that it would be Mori, but wanting to be certain.

"You, of course, Haruka-chan," the man said mildly. "I'm going to be very busy
for a whiles with the Fujiya-tachi, especially with the new Sumiyoshi-rengo
still in towns. But don't worry! I'll take care of that, and Kasai will helps
you out -- I won't have my future son-in-laws getting attacked again!"

Then he raised his hands and clapped them together, grinning fit to match his
daughter. "So! Kyon-kun here should eat somethings after his mission! Why
don't we have dinner?"

Shinobu swept into the room, kneeling betwen Tsuruya and her father in a
smooth, practiced motion. She bowed her head respectfully from her kneeling
position. "A...actually, Tsuruya-sama," Mori interrupted apologetically,
"Itsuki-kun and I already had dinner. And there's some paperwork I really have
to take care of...."

"Homework, myself," Koizumi said with a mournful smile, shrugging his
shoulders helplessly. The pair both rose and bowed politely to Tsuruya's
father.

"Well, good luck, then," the man allowed. "I supposes it's just the three of
us then, eh? Why don't--"

Shinobu coughed, very quietly, and Tsuruya thought she caught the most
fleeting glimpse of the maid shooting her father a warning look. He sat up
straighter at the table, patting his suit coat pockets before picking up the
unfolded origami. "Uh, hum, actually, I need to discuss some business with
Aida -- you two will have to have dinner without me." He rose from the table
and quickly strode away, pulling a phone from his pocket as he did.

"Take care, Tsuruya-sama," Kyon said politely, rising from his seat to bow to
the patriarch.

"Bye, Father!" she called, waving. "I'll see you on Saturdays for dinner,
alright?"

"Yes, yes," he agreed, looking back over his shoulder to shoot a smile at his
daughter and her fiance. "And you two have a nice evening! We shall have a
meal together another times!" After that, he vanished through the doorway,
already pressing a button on his phone.

"Hmm," Kyon mused, sinking to sit back at the table with a curious glance to
Shinobu.

She returned an innocent look, and Tsuruya decided that warranted
investigation ... later. For the time being, she said, "I'd like dinner for
Kyon-kun and I, please!"

"Understood," Shinobu agreed, bowing even lower before she rose and smoothly
began to glide away.

"So!" Tsuruya exclaimed cheerfully, reaching beneath the edge of the table and
fishing out the remote. "Let's catch up on some Trope-tan before the movies
tomorrow night!"

"Sure," he agreed, giving her an almost concealed smile of amusement before
turning to look at the wall partition that slid quietly away to reveal the
television behind it. "I think I saw through the end of season two with Kanae-
chan and Nagato."

After punching in the first episode of season three, she confided, "I don't
like this openings song as much as season two, but the endings are better."
Stretching out to lean against him comfortably, she rested her head on his
shoulder. "Hey," she wondered suddenly. "Haru-nyan is 'Haruhi', Kanae-chan is
'Kanae-chan', I get to be 'Tsuruya-kun'...." She trailed off and giggled,
thinking about Mikuru, then skipped ahead to her main point: "Why is Yuki-chan
still 'Nagato'?"

"Um," Kyon mused, frowning thoughtfully. "That is really not the question I
had expected. It might be nice to call her something else, but I guess I'm
just afraid of overstepping...?"

Tsuruya nodded thoughtfully at that. "Well, I thinks she wouldn't mind," she
assured him. "But, you can always asks her!"

"That's true," he admitted, sighing softly.

She smiled ruefully, realizing she had worried him more than she had managed
to calm him. "Well, don't worry about that! You did a great job on today's
missions; you can handle anything!"

He pulled slightly away from her, enough to give her a smile that told her she
had cheered him back up again.

Grinning back at him, she closed the distance between them for a kiss. It
might be time for dinner soon, but she was confident that Shinobu would cough
in warning.... As their lips touched, she wondered if the maid might instead
just cover the dishes and wait. She knew she wouldn't mind, and doubted Kyon
would, either.

* * *

Kanae's police-woman's costume was almost complete; Mikuru was positive she
would be done with it after one more good session of work. In the meantime,
the first year girl had agreed to let Mikuru wear her maid costume again, as
Kanae and Tsuruya were both heading to the Trope-tan movie with Kyon that
night. So, humming to herself, she pulled the bow tight just as Haruhi opened
the door explosively, looking momentarily chagrined at the realization that
she had almost exposed Mikuru -- again.

"Ah," Mikuru managed, slightly startled by the sudden appearance of the
brigade chief. "Um! I'll make the tea!"

"I should have dressed up today," Haruhi sighed, shaking her head. "We have to
figure out a better rotation for costumes."

"So far, I like pretty much all of them," Kyon mused. "Though, I have to admit
that I've only ever seen Haruhi in her cheongsam once."

"Suzumiya-sempai has a dress like that?" Kanae gasped, eyes widening. "Ooh,
those are, um, mature outfits!"

Mikuru felt her face redden, wondering what it meant that Haruhi had said the
outfit wouldn't be good for her. Haruhi's own face was a bit red, too. "I just
thought it stood out and was very pretty ... but I don't think that the
cheongsam is a moe outfit, like a maid's costume, or a nurse's uniform!"

The rest of the group trooped into the room and took their seats while Mikuru
prepared tea. At some point, Tsuruya and Kanae had gotten their own teacups
added to the collection -- Tsuruya's a handmade traditional piece with her
family crest on it, and Kanae a factory-issue hot-pink mug with a cheerfully
waving Trope-tan.

After the door shut, while Mikuru was still quietly humming to herself and
pouring, Haruhi rapped on her desk, surveying the collected brigade, her gaze
settling on Kyon. "Okay!" she called, smiling, leaning forward. "So, I hear
you had a mission last night, Kyon?"

He raised an eyebrow, looking up from where Koizumi was setting up a Stratego
board. "That's right," he agreed.

"All the details!" Haruhi demanded cheerfully. "I want to hear about
everything, since I didn't get to go!"

"I've pre-emptively classified the majority of my mission details," Kyon
countered smoothly, turning to his school bag and producing a small stack of
papers, the top of which read 'Confidential' in large characters. "I'm afraid
this file is sealed to my rank and higher."

"Is that so...?" Haruhi mused, raising one eyebrow speculatively. "There must
be incredibly sensitive information in this report -- hand it over!"

He shrugged, letting go of the papers as they flew through the air and into
Haruhi's hands. The brigade chief began excitedly shuffling through the
papers, reading them line-by-line. "Phone," she added, not looking up from the
report, one palm extended expectantly.

Kyon rolled his eyes, setting his PDA on the table and turning his attention
to the board between himself and Koizumi. Kanae watched excitedly, her
sketchbook close at hand, and Tsuruya was sitting next to Yuki, the pair of
them reading the Trope-tan manga. As the PDA began to drift towards Haruhi's
hand, Mikuru smiled, serving out the tea.

She started with Haruhi, then went around the table, setting Yuki's cup down
last. "There you go, Yuki-chan," she said cheerfully.

The smaller girl looked up, blinking once, and Mikuru got an odd sense of
reassurance, that somehow, Yuki was more relaxed. "Thank you," she returned
quietly.

Smiling, she stepped quietly behind Haruhi, freezing in alarm when the brigade
chief suddenly extended a hand towards her, offering Kyon's PDA. In the
meantime, Haruhi was still reading the papers, floating handily before her as
her other hand toyed with her hair. As it was, the brigade chief's hair had
grown surprisingly over the last month or so, probably a good six or seven
centimeters at least. Mikuru fought back the urge to try and braid it, instead
accepting the phone with an initial moment of confusion before realization set
in.

She managed to keep herself from squealing in delight as the PDA immediately
flipped to the 'wardrobe' function. Taking a breath to calm herself, she took
her seat near the tea set, smoothing her apron down before taking the first
sip of her own drink. That done, she skimmed through the recent costumes,
scrolling back to the selection that Haruhi had scanned earlier.

With a single touch against the screen, Kyon's clothing had been replaced with
the more classically refined outlines of the garb of Himura Kenshin -- a worn
but clean samurai's garb. He merely glanced at himself for the briefest moment
before playing a piece against Koizumi. Swallowing, Mikuru reached into the
pocket of her maid's outfit, producing her phone and quickly pulling up her
copy of the picture of Kyon in his apron. The PDA had no problems scanning the
picture of Kyon himself, and adding it to the collection.

Her finger hovered over the button, and she realized that Kanae was watching
her shyly from across the table. Swallowing, Mikuru forced herself to resist
pressing it, and put her own phone away. The important thing was, it was part
of the collection. Some day, her dream of a totally domestic Kyon would be
realized.

Until then.... She smiled at Kanae and flipped to another costume, dressing
Kyon in the outfit of Roy Mustang from Full Metal Alchemist. He spared another
glance for his cornflower blue military uniform, corded with gold at the
shoulders and bearing mysterious emblems of rank, then flashily snapped his
fingers when it was time for his next move, bumping the board and causing a
single piece to flip into position perfectly. "Showoff," Haruhi accused,
unable to keep from smirking as she glanced briefly up from reading the
report. "Especially after these so-well-detailed 'minor technicalities'!"

"I didn't hear about these?" Koizumi remarked, glancing between Kyon and
Haruhi curiously.

"That's classified," Kyon said without apology, making one last move. "Not
bad, Koizumi, better luck next time."

"Yep," Haruhi agreed, folding the papers together. "But those are some
surprising limitations on your abilities, Kyon."

"Thanks to Nagato, it's already been dealt with," he said with assurance,
pulling the handle of his energy blade from his coat. "Now this has other
modes."

"Like what?" Haruhi asked, intrigued. "It's a laser blade and...?"

"Sort of a harmonic key-simulator," he answered, frowning.

"So, a Swiss-army beam saber?" she teased, grinning.

"Sure," he agreed, tracing his fingertips across the handle. "It's mostly
sound-based in tool mode ... I think of it like a sonic screwdriver!"

"A name like that would never catch on," Haruhi determined, shaking her head.
"You'll need to work on that."

"I'm sure," he answered dryly, turning to Kanae as she produced a different
board game.

Haruhi watched for a moment, then turned to Yuki, tapping a fingertip against
the stack of papers. "Yuki-chan, what do you think about making a secure
filing cabinet? Something we can store Brigade paperwork and important
documents in?" she asked.

Yuki looked up from her Trope-tan manga, blinking as she met Haruhi's gaze. To
Mikuru, she looked somehow uncertain, hesitant before answering, "It can be
done."

Crossing her arms over her chest, Haruhi gave the shorter girl a doubtful
look. "Really?" she pressed.

"Security is ... interesting," Yuki admitted. Mikuru cheered internally, glad
that she had aknowledged such a thing, but aware of the way everyone else had
turned to look at small girl with that remark. Her pale hair shifting as she
tilted her face, Yuki turned her gaze to the low two drawer filing cabinet the
brigade room already held.

Mikuru was positive that the tiniest hints of pink had come to Yuki's cheeks,
and everyone else in the clubroom had turned to watch her. Kyon and Tsuruya
had the decency to do it covertly, despite knowing that Yuki was undoubtedly
completely aware. Koizumi was watching with mild interest, and Kanae was
staring with a wide-eyed smile, blushing in sympathy.

"In that case, would you like to design our secure vault?" Haruhi asked,
grinning.

Yuki gave a very solemn nod, raising one hand towards the filing cabinet,
freezing the merest distance away from touching it. She turned to look back at
Haruhi blankly.

"Go ahead!" Haruhi encouraged, nodding back. "Go all out!"

Yuki turned her gaze again, this time to Kyon, and Mikuru bit her lip, an
unexpected message from her superior causing her to nearly fumble the PDA, her
thumb jabbing the screen randomly before she caught it. Kyon's costume swapped
to a gleaming suit of elaborate armor -- the outfit of some knight from an RPG
that Haruhi had scanned previously. A billowing crimson cape filled the space
behind him, and he looked at her sternly.

"I think," he said cautiously, "that it's time for you to trust your own
judgment, too. You don't need my permission for this ... Yuki."

A squeak escaped Mikuru at that, and her eyes flew wide. Haruhi turned to
stare at him in surprise, and Tsuruya's quiet giggle began building up into
something even louder. Yuki froze, the tiny hints of pink in her cheek
intensifying slightly, developing into a genuine, if mild, blush. Her lips
formed something wordlessly, then she nodded at Kyon and turned her attention
back to the filing cabinet.

"Augh!" Haruhi yelped, diving for her schoolbag and tearing it open, sending
schoolbooks and papers everwhere. "Camera! Where's my camera!"

An instant later, a brilliant blue glow enveloped the entire cabinet, flashing
blindingly for a moment before fading away into nothing. The cabinet looked
exactly the same, except for the updated interface on Mikuru's augmented
reality. She realized with a jolt of annoyance that the update had been what
had made her press functions on the PDA at random. Scowling, she turned to the
device, wondering what she'd done....

Strangely enough, she realized she'd somehow accidentally recorded Yuki's
blush on Kyon's phone when the message had come through. "Um, Suzumiya-san,"
she called, holding the phone out for Haruhi's inspection. Instantly, Haruhi
was at Mikuru's side, half glomped onto the older girl as she crowded close to
watch the replay.

"This is going into the archives," she said momentously, watching the way
Yuki's blush had been perfectly captured on the PDA's larger screen.

"In the meantime," Kyon noted, glancing down at himself, "how long am I going
to be count Kyon von Tada--"

"Oh, hush," Haruhi overrode him, eagerly watching a second replay. "Did you,
or did you _not_ just see the most amazing explosion of moe within this room
ever just now?"

Kyon's eyebrows rose and he gave Haruhi a challenging stare. The fact that he
was wearing gleaming plate armor and a still-billowing crimson cape lent real
gravity to his normally implacable look. Somehow, instead of being silly, he
really just looked like he was some feudal lord, stepped forward from an
ancient time and only somewhat amused about the entire thing.

"W...what?" Haruhi demanded, slightly defensive, still clinging onto Mikuru.
"What's that stupid look mean!?"

"Nothing," Kyon relented, looking away, giving Yuki an apologetic shrug.

"Say, Kyon-kun," Tsuruya interjected smoothly, grinning, "do you knows any
German?"

"Just a few words here and there," he allowed, shrugging, one gauntleted hand
going forward to grab the dice and roll them. "Mostly from movies. I know
Japanese best."

"It's easy!" Tsuruya said cheerfully. "They use grammars very similar to
ours!"

Mikuru bit her lip with a smile, handing Kyon's PDA back to Haruhi. The
brigade chief released her, sending a copy of the precious video to her own
phone, while the time traveler busied herself preparing a second round of tea.
Was it possible to have a gift for languages, but to be unaware of it? He had
already established that he had a better knowledge of English than Haruhi,
much to her annoyance.

He insisted it was all just a combination of luck and simple strategy, but
Mikuru knew better. It was because he'd memorized such an extensive
vocabulary.... Really, she was starting to suspect that Kyon liked to play
dumb -- especially after how easily he figured out how to coerce that Fujiwara
character into cooperating with the time loop.

Tsuruya, fluent in German, began drilling Kyon in the basics; Mikuru's
augmented reality provided translations, and she giggled as she refilled
Kyon's teacup. Kanae initially looked bewildered, but Haruhi leapt to her
rescue: "It's perfect, Kanae-chan; Tsu-chan will distract Kyon with German,
and we'll study enough English to beat him in Scrabble next time!"

"As much time as we have," Kyon allowed, poking at one plate-wrapped wrist
with a frown before glancing to the clock. "Imouto and Miyoko-chan are going
to be waiting for us to take them to the Trope-tan movie tonight."

"Ooh!" Tsuruya cheered, brightening. "That's right! Kanae-chan, you'll have to
come home with me, so we can dress up together! Kyon-kun, you'll make sure
that Imouto-kun and Miyoko-chan are ready?"

"If I don't, my mom will," he agreed, giving a lopsided smirk.

Haruhi grimaced at that, before remarking, "Okay, fine. Yuki-chan, Mikuru-
chan, we should meet up tonight, anyway."

"Okay," Mikuru agreed cheerfully. She envied Tsuruya and Kanae a little bit,
but she'd gotten to see movies with Kyon before; she couldn't really begrudge
them that much. "Does that sound fun, Yuki-chan?"

Yuki nodded, not looking up from her manga, but adopting her tiny
almost-a-smile expression.

"Good!" Haruhi cheered, clapping her hands together.

* * *

After walking home with Kyon's sister, the two had finished their weekend
homework together, just settling down in the living room to play a game when
the front door opened, Kyon calling that he had returned. Miyoko was a step
behind Nonoko in the dash to the hall, both of them beaten by Nonoko's and
Kyon's mother.

"You're going out with Tsuruya-chan again tonight, aren't you?" the woman
fussed, studying Kyon's clothing as though he were going to the movie in his
school uniform.

"That's right," he agreed, nonplussed as he switched his casual shoes for his
house-slippers. "Kanae-chan, Imouto, and Miyoko-chan are going to be with us,
too." He slipped around the woman as she pursed her lips and turned to watch
him in thoughtful silence. "Oh, hey, you two," he added when he saw the
smaller girls, tousling Nonoko's hair when she glomped onto him.

"Trope-tan movie tonight!" Nonoko barked, grinning up at Kyon.

"I missed you, too," he replied, rolling his eyes.

"Um, thank you for inviting me, Kyon-nii-san," Miyoko managed, feeling her
cheeks pinken slightly. Now, if Koizumi had been going, too, then it would be
a perfect evening....

"Any time, Miyoko-nee-chan," he replied, winking before he turned to jog up
the stairs.

"Kyon," Nonoko's mother began, too late, as he was already out of earshot. She
stared after him thoughtfully, then turned to Nonoko. "You know, your
brother's growing into a fine young man, but sometimes I wonder at how quickly
it seems to happen...."

For her part, Miyoko's friend gave her mother a blank, confused look before
shrugging and turning a questioning look at Miyoko. "Um," Miyoko managed,
giggling nervously, "I think that Kyon-nii-san is just doing his best. Isn't
that admirable enough?"

The mother of Miyoko's best friends didn't have an answer for that, just
turning to the door when a knock sounded. "Tsuruya-chan!" she greeted the girl
standing outside in surprise. "Ah ... how good to see you again! Kyon's just
upstairs, changing."

Miyoko felt her mouth dropping open at the sight of Tsuruya in a sleek, very
classy black dress -- a slinky affair that seemed to magically cling to the
older girl. It came down to end mid-thigh, belted with a thin golden chain,
and showed just enough pale skin across her chest to be enticing without being
what Miyoko thought was trashy; she immediately wished she had one, and that
it would look nearly as good on her the next time she ran into Koizumi.

"Okies!" Tsuruya said cheerfully. "Kanae-chan and I are ready as soon as
everyone else is!"

"Pretty hair!" Nonoko remarked, in awe of the way that Tsuruya's long hair had
been painstakingly braided, a woven cord that ran to her knees, even bound up
with the pretty dragonfly clips at the end.

"And a lovely dress, too," Nonoko's mother agreed.

Tsuruya giggled, ducking at the praise, then shook her head. "I just hopes
Kyon-kun likes it-- Oh! Kyon-kun~!"

The boy in question stared at her, slowing as he trotted down the stairs to
come to a full stop in another of his nice suits, right next to Miyoko. "Ah,
Tsuruya-kun," he managed after a moment, trying not to stare. "You look
great!"

"Thank you, Kyon-kun!" Tsuruya chirped, twirling in place and then winking at
him. "I thoughts about a pony-tail, but decided a braids would be better for
tonight!"

Kyon gave a very rare puzzled look at that, then shook his head. "Um ... is it
time already?"

"I'd likes to get there a bit early," Tsuruya admitted. "The premiere was last
nights at midnight, but this is a special showings. The directors and staff of
the movie and seasons three and five will be there!" She bounced excitedly on
her toes, which Miyoko thought a bit jealously caused some interesting things
to happen beneath her dress, then twirled perfectly in place on one toe again
before stopping, one arm extended towards Kyon.

This time, her skirt spun around her with her momentum, giving a brief flash
of her long legs before it settled, only just missed by Nonoko's mother as the
woman fussed over both of the younger girls, making sure they had everything
they would need for the evening. "I'll take good cares of them," Tsuruya
promised, as Kyon crooked his elbow for her to take in her own arm. "And Kyon-
kun, too!"

"He really should have gotten her some flowers," the woman muttered, too
quietly for the couple up front to hear as they trooped away. Miyoko shook her
head, wondering if Kyon's sister had noticed any of the things she had. As it
was, she suddenly had the worried notion that she and Kyon's sister were
interfering with what might have been a romantic evening.

Shortly, they were in the limousine, much to Miyoko's amazement. She'd never
been in such a vehicle before, until the last weekend's beach trip, though
both Kyon and Tsuruyra seemed to be familiar with it; Kanae was in the back,
looking a bit nervously uncomfortable, herself, dressed similarly to Tsuruya.
Miyoko tried to give the other girl an encouraging smile, even while taking
solace in her presence. Surely it couldn't be a date with two other girls
closer to his own age...? Miyoko wondered why that thought seemed so very
familiar.

Shortly enough, Kyon was seated on the long bench-like seat, between Kanae and
Nonoko, and Miyoko had gotten a seat on the other bench next to Tsuruya.

"I feel under-dressed," Miyoko confessed, plucking at her plain skirt and
blushing.

"You aren't," Nonoko countered swiftly, before anyone else could speak. "It's
no good if only I'm wearing normal clothes!"

Miyoko felt her face flush as Tsuruya put an arm around her shoulder. "You can
dress up when you're as old as you looks," the green-haired girl promised her,
grinning.

"W...what's that supposed to mean?" Miyoko whimpered in protest, her blush
deepening.

The older girl burst into laughter, while Kanae gave her an apprehensive look.
Kyon leaned forward, closer to Miyoko, and asked, "Are you looking forward to
seeing the movie? So far, the reviews are saying that 'Trope-tan Begins' is
the best Trope-tan film to-date."

"I ... don't know much more about the series than what Nono-chan has told me,
and the few episodes I've picked up so far," Miyoko admitted, her blush
fading. "I like what I've seen so far, though!"

"I haven't gotten much past the start of season three, myself," Kyon
confessed, smiling apologetically. "I hope we won't be too confused."

"Me, too," Miyoko agreed, giggling nervously.

"I'll sit next to you!" Nonoko said eagerly, nodding at her friend. "I'll help
you out if anything needs explaining!"

"I'll do the same for Kyon-kun," Tsuruya chirped, giggling. "It's my faults
that Kyon-kun didn't get past season three!"

Kyon blushed at that, for some reason, but Miyoko wasn't certain why -- or how
it was the older girl's fault. She decided it was better not to ask, in any
case.... Soon enough, the limousine had come to a stop and the group had
trouped out, into a small cleared area lined with somber, well-dressed
security personel. Beyond that was a milling crowd of reporters, most of them
surprisingly well dressed, all of them eagerly snapping pictures.

Miyoko tried her best to look dignified and poised as she followed the much
better dressed group past the flashing cameras, but found herself suddenly
alone; Nonoko abandoned her to run up and grab her brother's hand. Almost
instantly, Tsuruya drifted back, taking one of Miyoko's hands reassuringly in
her own, somehow seeming to deflect or absorb the attention of the crowd away.
A heartbeat later, they were through the doors and into a palatial theater
lobby, brilliantly lit with dazzling golden ornaments trailing crimson banners
festooning the upper reaches of the vaulted ceiling.

The relative silence left Miyoko wobbling at the sudden shift from unexpected
crowd to equally unexpected sedate, mostly empty space. "Sorries!" Tsuruya
apologised, patting her hand reassuringly. "I forgot to warn you about that
parts. But don't worry! I'll stay by you next times, okies?"

"Imouto," Kyon murmured, looking at his sister sternly. She blushed darkly,
releasing Kyon's hand and turning to face Miyoko.

"Sorry," she mumbled. "I ran to Kyon-kun when there were so many people...."

Miyoko stifled a sigh internally, and gave her friend a smile. "It's okay,"
she reassured her friend.

"Right!" Tsuruya agreed instantly. "After all, Miyoko-chan has Tsuru-nee to
watch over her, too!"

Miyoko giggled at that, looking around as another group of well-dressed men
and women came through the doors, moving around them before striding across
the quiet, empty area to the double-doors beneath the 'Trope-tan Begins'
marquee.

"For tonights, this entire theater is just for the Trope-tan movie!" Tsuruya
explained, leading the group across the hallway to where a group of ushers
were waiting. A few minutes later, they were all seated in a half-full
auditorium, listening to the subdued chatter of dozens of other people as they
waited for the movie to begin. Surprisingly enough, as excited as she was,
Nonoko ended up dozing during the wait, while Kyon obligingly got up to get
snacks for everyone.

Miyoko patted her sleeping friend's shoulder, then glanced to the other side
-- where Kanae was sitting, a space between her and Tsuruya still waiting for
Kyon. Kyon returned, bearing an overloaded tray of drink cups and popcorn,
sighing good-naturedly at his sleeping sister when he returned. He and Miyoko
made a hasty bucket-brigade, ferrying the items by hand over the smaller girl
until the tray was empty, and he woke her by gently bopping her with the
cardboard tray.

"I didn't fall asleep," she instantly mumbled defensively, blearily sitting
up. "I'm not too tired for the movie!"

"I'm sure," Kyon agreed, smirking.

Nonoko blushed and consoled herself with her soda, while Kyon settled back
into his seat.... And Miyoko didn't at all miss the way that Kanae
repositioned herself, leaning across the arm between their seats and pressing
against Kyon. She felt her face turn red and quickly turned to the screen, as
the house lights dimmed.

A spotlight targeted a podium at the base of the screen, and an unfamiliar man
appeared, giving a short speech that Miyoko couldn't quite follow before
thunderous applause flooded the room. Nonoko whispered over the roar that the
man was the senior character designer for the Trope-tan movie, and then he
bowed and the spotlight went out. The area was pitch-black, and Miyoko felt
the familiar sense of Nonoko's hand grabbing her own, fumbling in the darkness
before the first bits of music began to pour through the speakers, and the
crowd when silent.

The screen lit up, and then Miyoko lost track of time as an explosion of color
splashed across the screen, quickly resolving into familiar shapes as the film
began.

Later, once the movie had ended, Miyoko found herself, still dizzy from the
loud noise, and somewhat giddy and misty-eyed from the finale. She felt stuck
speechless from the end of the film until they climbed into Tsuruya's waiting
limousine. Kyon's sister was happily babbling about the surprise appearance of
Trope-tan's friends, Quote-tan, Wikipe-tan, and Media-tan -- Nonoko was
explaining how they were a power-trio, sisters who had formed a group called
the 'commons-tans.' Miyoko nodded, then turned a grateful smile at Kyon.

"What did you think?" Tsuruya asked him, when the door was closed, and the
vehicle had smoothly rolled into motion.

"That was a really good movie," he decided, grinning. "Of course, the company
didn't hurt." Whatever that meant, it made Kanae giggle and blush, and Tsuruya
grab onto Kyon and squeeze him tightly.

"Good!" the older girl chirped, nuzzling briefly against Kyon before releasing
him, pinkening slightly at the way Kanae stared at her with wide-eyes. "Ah ...
so! Miyoko-chan, Imouto-kun, you had good times?"

"The best!" Nonoko agreed, throwing her arms wide. "Thanks to Kyon-kun and
Tsuru-nee-chan!"

"My fiancee gets a 'nee-chan', and I'm still 'Kyon'," he muttered to himself,
rolling his eyes.

"That's because Kyon is Kyon," his sister returned with a smirk. "Auntie Rika
said so!"

He scowled at his sister, who merely giggled in response. "Um, Sempai?" Kanae
ventured, before he spoke.

"What is it, Kanae-chan?" he asked, his annoyance vanishing as he turned to
look at the girl at his side.

"Um, I've wondered.... Can you tell me why people call you by that instead of
your name?" He stared at her for a moment, then glanced inquisitively to
Tsuruya, who was already clapping both hands to her mouth, trying to stifle
her laughter. Kanae's face darkened nervously with each moment that he
hesitated to answer.

"I really can't say," he finally relented, when she looked nearly ready to
faint. "I don't honestly know."

Miyoko bit her lip, giving the boy a sympathetic look. Well, she could cheer
him up quickly enough, she realized. "Don't worry about it!" she encouraged
him. "If I can beat my nickname, you can too...." She trailed off and realized
that much to her horror, she couldn't actually _remember_ his real name. She
could call him by his _family_ name, but that was hopelessly formal,
considering their familiarity! "I know you can, um, Aniki," she tried,
somewhat lamely.

Tsuruya seemed to have figured it out, because if anything, she began to laugh
harder, until the infectious amusement drowned out Miyoko's embarassment and
everyone else began to laugh, too.

Even though she didn't really understand _everything_, when they stopped at
her house so that Kyon and Nonoko could walk her to her door, she felt she
could honestly thank them both for a great time.

* * *

In too much of a good mood to mind that Taniguchi had shoved a broom into his
hands and demanded that he take over the taller boy's cleaning duties for the
half-day, Kyon and a somewhat irritated Kunikida tidied up the room, along
with Sakanaka. The class rep, Goto, had stayed a few minutes to collect papers
before running off to the office, but the three remaining students were able
to clean the room easily enough.

As Sakanaka put up the cleaning supplies, Kyon and Kunikida finished
rearranging the desks and chairs. "Sorry that Taniguchi forced you into this,
Kyon," Kunikida remarked, shaking his head as he collected his schoolbag.

"No problem," he replied, glancing to one side where Sakanaka fiddled with her
own bag, repeatedly glancing towards the pair of them as she hesitated. Kyon
wondered briefly what might have been bothering her, then decided he shouldn't
worry about it; she and Haruhi were friends. Surely Haruhi would mention if it
were serious. "Well, you two take care."

For whatever reason, Sakanaka looked flustered at the comment, though Kunikida
didn't react much beyond nodding. "You, too," the boy replied, checking his
phone. "Ah ... I've got to hurry to cram school." With that, he collected his
bag and quickly trotted out the door.

Kyon turned at the tiny sigh Sakanaka heaved when his short friend vanished.
"Something wrong, Sakanaka-san?"

"Er, no, no," she said quickly, shaking her head in denial as she picked up
her own bag. "J...just.... Ah, it's nothing, Kyon-kun. Um.... Well, enjoy your
free time; I'll see you later!"

He couldn't help but think he was missing something as she hurriedly jogged
away, looking strangely disappointed to him. "Huh," he mused, frowning.

A quiet cough pulled his attention from the doorway that Sakanaka had fled
through to the classroom's other door, where Koizumi was standing, with a
slightly more natural smile than his usual. "Are you finished cleaning?" he
asked politely.

Kyon snorted and shouldered his bag, closing both of the doors before stepping
into the hall. "Haruhi sent you to find me because I was taking too long?" he
asked.

"I volunteered for the duty, actually," Koizumi replied with a tiny shake of
his head, before adjusting his tie with a small amount of pride. "I am your
personal assistant, after all."

"No way that comment could possibly be misconstrued," he retorted, falling
into step at the esper's side as the two began walking towards the clubroom
very slowly.

"As it happens, based on recent discussions, I've spent some time learning the
limitations of my powers," Koizumi began in a low voice, casting about for
potential eavesdroppers.

Kyon nodded; knowing what his own limitations were seemed to be a critical
exercise, lately. Obviously he wasn't the only one who would benefit.

"Interestingly enough," the esper continued, "my powers functioned previously
on my awareness of Suzumiya-san's emotional state, and the fact that my own
emotions are separate. If you will, imagine that using my powers requires
detailed awareness of two emotional states. It's difficult to explain, but
it's the differences between those two that allows me to define what my power
is and does."

"You're saying that your power doesn't work if you're not linked to Haruhi,"
Kyon surmised, frowning. Haruhi hadn't liked realizing Koizumi was listening
in on her feeings. Restoring that link so that Koizumi could use his
powers....

"That's not precisely the case," Koizumi returned, smiling. "Suzumiya-san
didn't destroy my ability to connect to the minds of others.... She merely
removed _herself_ as an endpoint for that link."

Kyon blinked, mulling this over. "So," he said slowly, glancing at the esper
sidelong, "you've got a 'link' with someone else?"

"No!" Koizumi said, sounding strangely pleased, his smile widening. "Or
rather, not a _specific_ person," he clarified. "Now instead of being
'locked', as it were, to Suzumiya-san, I can read from nearly anyone I am
aware of."

Kyon considered this further as they reached the staircase to the clubroom. "I
see," he ventured cautiously.

"I suspect that with practice, I may be able to read surface thoughts, not
just feelings," Koizumi continued, nodding happily. "But the reason I bring
this up is the fact that there are people that I cannot read." He stopped in
the switchback of the stairwell, dropping his voice slightly lower again. "It
shouldn't surprise you to find that I cannot read Suzumiya-san, anymore.
Likewise, Nagato-san is blocked to me, and Asahina-san is similarly guarded to
my senses."

As he stopped, Kyon couldn't help but nod at Koizumi; that much, he would have
expected. "That makes sense," he aknowledged. Though, the fact that anyone
could read Mikuru's feelings on her face rendered her mysterious defense
somewhat moot.

"Kanae scans very faintly, compared to most people," Koizumi continued.
"Tsuruya-san appears completely normal from what I can discern...."

Kyon furrowed his brows as he stared at Koizumi, frowning. "So, well ... that
all seems fine, to me," he said. "I'd urge against eavesdropping personally,
especially on people who might be able to do something about it."

"Understandable, and I don't have any particular desire to upset my friends,"
Koizumi agreed. "However, all the same, I feel you should know ... when I
attempted to read you, I found that there's nothing there."

Kyon blinked at that. "Maybe I was just feeling really calm at that point," he
suggested.

Koizumi shook his head. "For Nagato-san, I can sense that she's there, but
it's like there's a wall of some sort, an invisible barrier. For Suzumiya-san,
the sensation is more like a strong wind that keeps me away. For Asahina-san,
it's like a more solid block than Nagato-san's ... not as expertly made, but
more than sufficient.

"However, when I try and sense your emotions," he said, raising a fingertip to
tap the side of his head, "it's as though you simply aren't _there_."

Feeling very uncomfortable with that revelation, Kyon nodded. "I'll visit with
Yuki tonight and ask her what she thinks about it," he decided. "Thanks for
the heads-up, Koizumi."

"I'm still not worried," Koizumi noted with a shrug, smiling. "Most likely
it's just some defense that Nagato-san has arranged for you ... or possibly
even just a limitation of my own skill, poorly trained as it is at that point.
I thought you might like to know, all the same."

Kyon nodded again, taking a final moment to consider things before trudging up
the stairs. Right up until then, he'd really been able to enjoy those
confusing moments when he'd dropped his sister off at home and then gone back
to Tsuruya's place with her and Kanae. They had dinner while watching more
Trope-tan anime, and when Kanae had excused herself to answer a phone call
from her parents, Tsuruya had gleefully tackled Kyon to the floor for a brief,
but enjoyable, makeout session.

After that, he'd gone with Tsuruya to drop Kanae off, walking her to her door
and unexpectedly finding the smaller girl launching herself at him, too.
Worried about being caught, and more worried about her thinking he was
rejecting her, Kyon found himself surprised by how easy it was to return the
slider's inexperienced kiss. And that was enjoyable, too.

That had made things very confusing, so he hadn't said much of anything to
Tsuruya on the ride home except to thank her again. She released him with a
giggling wink and a kiss on the cheek, and then he'd tried to just think about
the positives and remember what Tsuruya had said earlier.

All that was gone now, thanks to Koizumi's new revelation. The esper was a
half-step ahead of him, so opened the clubroom door and stepped through first.
Once again, the newest costume play had taken him by surprise; he was so
prepared for the sight of Kanae in a policewoman's uniform that Haruhi being
the one in costume seemed totally unexpected.

She was wearing her Chinese dress, her hair done up in a pair of cloth-wrapped
buns. She was currently leaning over the table at Kanae's side, while the
younger girl stared at the paper before her in determined concentration. Yuki
sat further down the table, working on the last few volumes of the Trope-tan
manga, while Tsuruya and Mikuru were engaged in a game of shogi -- at a
glance, Kyon thought Tsuruya was winning, but he recognized how Mikuru could
easily revise her strategy.

Haruhi looked up first, flashing Kyon an impatient grin. "Phone," she
demanded, one hand going out.

He rolled his eyes and pulled the device from his invisible greatcoat pocket,
letting her levitate it towards her while her gaze went back to Kanae. "Nice
to see you too," he greeted her.

The brigade chief's expression shifted into a smirk. Koizumi took the seat
near Kanae, setting his bag on the table as he glanced at Kanae's paper. "Ah,"
he said, nodding knowingly. "Suzumiya-san made you a practice exam?"

The slider nodded, sticking her tongue out with effort as she concentrated,
and carefully picked out the answer for the next problem.

Kyon sat opposite Koizumi, uncertain of what to do. He wasn't sure if he felt
like playing a game, but if it was any game, Mikuru and Tsuruya had
inadvertently gotten him interested in shogi, and the group would probably
want to play some multi-player game next instead.

Mikuru's quiet giggle, and Tsuruya's louder chortle alerted him to the fact
that Haruhi had changed his own costume. He glanced down, not etirely
surprised to see a movie-perfect Chinese kung-fu outfit. "What is this from?"
he asked, bemused.

"'Fearless'," Haruhi answered without hesitation. Kyon thought he vaguely
remembered that movie, and wondered if the illusion extended to him having
half of his head shaved and a braid running down his back.

His ruminations were quickly interrupted by Haruhi seizing the collar of his
greatcoat, invisible as it was; the coat automatically shifted the illusion it
projected to make it appear as though Haruhi had grabbed his kung-fu outfit,
instead. He felt somehow certain that Haruhi knew what the proper name for the
garb was.

He was unceremoniously hauled out of his seat, though due to height
difference, he had to stand up on his own. "Yes, Haruhi?" he asked placidly,
turning to look at the girl hanging onto his clothes. She didn't meet his
eyes, her cheeks pinkening faintly. "Koizumi-kun, Kanae-chan has eighteen
minutes left on that test; help make sure she's not interrupted. Kyon-kun and
I have to discuss something!"

And at that, Haruhi took off, forcing Kyon to either jog with her, or let her
physically drag him out of the clubroom, down the stairs, and without any
doubt, straight to a very familiar stairwell. She skidded to a halt as they
approached the steps, mouth dropping open in surprise at the sight of
Taniguchi and Yanagimoto coming down the stairs.

Unaware, somehow, of the two brigade members in Chinese garb, the couple
descended together, Yanagimoto fussing with the tie of her school uniform
blouse and muttering darkly at Taniguchi, and for his part, the boy smirking
and looking aloof. Both of them had faintly flushed red faces, and given
Haruhi's designs for the space, Kyon found it wasn't hard to guess what they'd
been up to.

Yanagimoto cut off suddenly, eyes widening as she spotted Kyon and Haruhi
first. "Uh," she managed, freezing in place, then hurriedly looking down at
her blouse before dropping her hands to her sides. "Um...." Her face began to
darken, turning deeper red, while Taniguchi's smug grin widened.

"So--" he began, before being cut off by Haruhi.

"We got dressed up as martial artists to investigate the haunted corner of the
school," she said, with a strangely hooded, unimpressed gaze, "and we find out
the 'haunting' is just you two?"

"D...don't tell anyone!" Yanagimoto begged. "I don't know how I let him talk
me into it--"

Haruhi waved a hand to cut her off. "Say no more," she sighed. "It's
Taniguchi's stupidity, so it isn't really fair to punish you for that...."

"Hey!" Taniguchi protested, before Kyon interrupted, cutting the boy off
again.

"Don't you have studying to do, anyway?" Kyon asked Taniguchi, deciding that
for the sake of Yanagimoto's humilitation, he'd pretend he hadn't noticed her.

"Yeah, yeah," Taniguchi sighed, deflated somewhat. "Okay, fine, put down the
clue-by-fours, I can take a hint...." He gave Kyon a pointed glance, raising
an eyebrow, before turning to the girl at his side. "Yanagimoto-hime, shall we
go and study?"

"Yes," she gasped out in response, grabbing his wrist and fleeing down the
hall away from Kyon and Haruhi, not waiting to discuss things further. Without
Haruhi's amazing strength, he was amused to note how much slower their flight
was, before turning to look at the girl in the cheongsam, crossing his arms
over his chest.

"You know," he remarked, "Koizumi told me how you handled things when I was
... unconscious after that Sumiyoshi-rengo attack."

She flinched at that, scowling and discarding the masks she had shown the
other couple. "Bringing that up again," she grumbled, shaking her head.

He gently took her hand in his, glancing back down the hall. Even with no one
in sight, he decided it was safer in the stairwell, and led her there. She
didn't resist, after a moment seeming to recover and walking in pace with him.
As he reached the final step, she moved ahead of him, stopping with their
faces roughly level, though she looked away.

"Look," she said, shifting her shoulders uncomfortably. "That was terrible for
me -- for all of us. I.... I'm glad we were able to get through it, but--"

"Okay, that wasn't the right thing to say," he overrode her, shaking his head
apologetically and releasing her hand to rest his grip on her shoulder
comfortingly. "Let's step back further, over a year ago. When we were trying
to get into Nagato's building to investigate, you surprised me with how well
you questioned the superintendent."

Her discomfort vanished as she turned a purely quizzical look at him.

"You put on a role and you played it without any notice," he explained,
smiling. "Like a secret agent," he decided. Or a confidence artist, but he
didn't feel the need to say that much.

She looked surprised and satisfied at that, slowly smiling. Her eyes flicked
to his, and then away, lightning quick. "Well ... thanks, Kyon. Um ... you
should go visit Yuki-chan tonight," she mumbled.

"I was planning on doing that," he admitted, before he could stop himself.

Haruhi raised an eyebrow at that, her eyes locking onto his, and he wondered
if he should activate his skinsuit and forcefield before she had a chance to
shove or hit him. "Good," Haruhi decided, grinning. "Then I don't have to feel
guilty!"

With that, he met her kiss and gratefully forgot all about everything else for
a little while.

* * *

While she didn't mind him calling her up and asking her to teleport him early,
for reasons it was difficult for her to define, it relieved the pressure of
holding the day's junk data in check. As each day passed, she was able to
refine the processes that handled that data, lessening the workload in general
-- to say nothing of the bolstering effects of those occasional moments of
intimacy with her primary protection target.

So, with a deal of effort, but lacking the courage to put it into words, she
surmised that an average high school girl waiting for her male lover might
find his current endeavor 'cute'. He had called her earlier, so she knew he
was coming -- but the subordinate data of his PDA gave her occasional updates
as to his whereabouts and condition, anyway, at least one every few dozen
picoseconds. Under the guise of the stealth field in the coat that Mikuru had
made, and she and Haruhi had modified, he bypassed the security doors by
leaping up the side of the building, managing long, arcing jumps between
landings until he lit on the space before her door.

She was already waiting for him, holding it open and trying to restrain her
involuntary reactions with mixed success. The same capillary excitement that
happened occasionally was sparked off already, and her lips wanted to curl
slightly despite her own motor control functions.

He gave a little sigh and a roll of his eyes as he glanced around to make sure
no one was watching, then stepped inside and dropped his stealth function. She
observed the way he became visible to her eyes as well as her other senses,
shrugging off the coat and draping it over one arm. "Heya, um ... Yuki," he
ventured as she closed the door.

An involuntary reaction on her part caused her to twitch, inadvertently
slamming the door in surprise for some reason, even as her capillary
excitement went into overdrive. She tried to turn to face him, despite the
fact that further strange muscle motions tried to turn her eyes away.

"I...is it okay to call you that, Nagato?" he asked anxiously, his smile
fading.

She had determined that a part of her being resonated with the more personal
name, and that it should probably be called 'enjoyable'. By that same token,
however, she had also determined that it caused her self-control to waver, and
her behavior to deviate dangerously. The only logical conclusion was that it
wasn't safe for him to call her by another name.

"Yuki...rin ... is okay," she said, which she found disconcerting, considering
her logical conclusion that she shouldn't say such a thing.

He gave her a strange look, his smile returning as he ducked, doffing his
shoes and slipping inside. She moved past him, engaging herself in the
familiar ritual of preparing tea for him. He gave her a more calculating look
than usual as he took a seat at the table. She handed him a teacup and he
accepted it with a solemn nod of his head, murmuring, "Thank you, um ... Yuki-
rin."

Yuki found another series of those invuluntary reactions had almost caused her
to spill her tea, so instead patiently set the kettle down. Her eyes fixed on
his and she warned him, "I am experiencing a near-error state."

His eyes widened with worry. "What should I do?" he asked her anxiously. "How
can I help?"

She rose from her place at the table and moved to his side. "Requesting that
alias has an unexpected side-effect that seems similar to the reaction as
observed in the case of Asahina Mikuru."

He blinked, then looked to one side, his own face flushing red. "O...okay," he
managed. "S...so you know about that.... Um.... S...so I shouldn't call you by
that, then?"

She knelt next to him and observed her arms going around him. He nervously
hugged her back, before she pushed him to the floor and lowered herself to lay
atop him. "Be careful," she murmured, before kissing him, taking initiative
for once.

He kissed her back, and when she broke it she managed to explain, "This
keyphrase temporarily erodes my self-control," before silencing any protest he
might voice with another searching kiss. After a few minutes, she let him
breathe, realizing aloud, "I trust you with this key." He was trying to say
something in response, but for a little while, she was too busy kissing him to
listen much.

Some time later, when she was in control of herself again, she lay curled atop
him, the side of her face resting on his chest while he heaved for breath,
recovering herself. She checked her log of actions, replaying what she had
done with him, and found she hadn't exceeded any of her previously established
permissions. There was a risk in the future, though, so she delivered one
final warning, explaining, "Repeated use of this alias may disable certain
inhibitions."

Strangely, she felt absolutely confident trusting him with that. He gave her a
curious look, then shook his head, sitting up. She slid into his lap, still
leaning against him. "Okay," he said, his voice a tiny bit ragged, "um, we
shouldn't just.... Er.... So, Yuki..." She felt herself tensing, uncertain if
he would complete the alias, or.... "...chan, um, w...would you like to go out
to dinner with me tonight?"

The near-utterance of her nickname made her face redden again, though not as
badly as before. Without releasing him, her face still pressed into his chest,
she nodded.

* * *

After taking Yuki out to dinner at the same Tsuruya-gumi-owned establishment
he had taken his own family, Kyon had walked the smaller girl back to her
apartment, and then been more than happy to recieve a single good-night kiss
from her -- though for his _own_ self control, he didn't stay with her. He
knew he'd see her soon enough, after all, for the nightly training.

The training came and went, now just another note of his normal sleeping
cycle, and he found himself waking in the hazy glow of half-remembered lessons
and practice. Someone in his bed made a quiet, mumbling noise and squirmed
around; a moment later, he felt a small, warm presence pressing against his
body, nestled naturally into the curve of his own sleeping form.

For the first time in a long while, he considered sleeping in, giving his
little sister a few moments to salvage her dignity and run off. He resolved to
give her a few minutes, at the very least, his musings turning to what might
have scared the little girl so much she had run into his bed.... It had been
months since she'd sneaked in to sleep with him. And, come to think of it, he
mused, how had she managed to sneak in without him waking up, this time?

Stifling a yawn rather than risk waking the girl, he opened his eyes in
bemusement and carefully peeled back the covers, revealing a familiar mop of
curly brown hair -- but not his sister's. He stared in consternation for a
long minute, his mouth dropping open as Kanae turned fitfully in her sleep,
one arm going around him as she hugged herself to him and mumbled something
incomprehensible.

Now, he thought to himself, how did _this_ particular anime cliche come to
happen?
