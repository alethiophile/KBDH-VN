"Chapter Four: Capability"

"Of particular concern is the possibility that you project an image that is
too confident for your ability, and then are called upon to do something you
are not qualified or capable of doing. It's better to be underestimated than
overestimated, in the long term. Otherwise, you're just bluffing, and when the
bluff is called...."

"Suzumiya-san," Koizumi asked, jogging along at her side without much
difficulty, "might I trouble you to ask where we are going?"

"There's a path to the top of those rocks," she answered without hesitation,
weaving effortlessly through the beach-towels and umbrellas dotting the beach.
Shortly they had reached the stretch beyond desirable campgrounds, drier and
somewhat stonier sand. With less obstacles to dodge, and no beach-goers around
to get in her way, Haruhi sped up.

He was able to keep the pace she set, but wished it wasn't such a strain....
He had a lot more sympathy for Kyon these days, however. As far as the club
went, he'd gone from being the 'mysterious esper transfer student' to just
being a liaison between his friends and the Organization he used to serve. It
wasn't so bad, but he was starting to realize that, intended or not, he had
previously spent a lot of time being condescending to Kyon.

Hah, now _he_ was the closest thing to a 'normal' person in the brigade.
Haruhi the reality warper, Yuki the alien interface, Mikuru the time traveler,
Kanae the slider, Tsuruya the ninkyo dantai heiress, Kyon the.... Well, he
wasn't certain how to classify Kyon, but 'normal person' only qualified for
personality at this point. In capability he had become something entirely
different, though. In any case, at the end of that list was Koizumi, the
esper.

Not that 'esper' meant much more than having a second, very unwelcome screen
of Haruhi's feelings crashing through his own thoughts and emotions, now. More
and more, Koizumi was becoming confident that his theory of Kyon _destroying_
closed space was the truth. Without any closed space for him to be an esper
in, that meant that Koizumi wasn't really much more than a normal person
himself.

And at the moment, while he wanted to be friends with Kyon, he was incredibly
uncomfortable at Haruhi's emotions when the two were ... intimate. Even though
it would ostensibly be for the greater good, he dreaded the thought of their
relationship developing further.

He broke from those thoughts when they reached the base of the rock pile,
Haruhi turning away from the sea without any hesitation. The high top of the
sea-facing cliff sloped gradually down as the land sloped up, and shortly
before the beach ended entirely, at the beachfront road, Haruhi leaped without
hesitation into the brush. Koizumi followed with slightly more caution,
finding that she hadn't leaped into the bushes, but onto a mostly-concealed
pathway between the rocky outcrop's unchecked vegetation.

From there, it was a fairly straight path, except where it twisted around a
larger tree or copse of some prickly bushes. Koizumi estimated that it took
them less than a minute to reach the abrupt end of their trail when Haruhi
skidded to a halt, grabbing onto a gnarled tree branch to arrest her momentum.
Forewarned, he stopped somewhat more gracefully, still putting one hand out to
briefly steady himself against another tree.

Below the pair of them was a steep slope of jagged boulders leading down to
the beach proper. A hidden beach, really, nestled between two rocky arms of
cliff face, probably some ancient natural feature left intact to segregate the
public beach from a private one further on. At the moment, Koizumi could only
stare in astonishment, not really able to absorb the natural details.

A good length of the wash, from the shoreline to the further rocky outcropping
-- the western side -- had been transformed into a slowly cooling trench of
molten sand. The glowing line led from some strange meters-tall construct of
shiny metal, connecting it to a glowing, slagged heap of rock at the base of
the rock cliffs below. Pushing himself up from the sand, evidently unharmed,
Kyon dazedly climbed upright, Kanae shivering and curled into a ball near his
feet.

"Enemies!" Haruhi declared, scowling, reaching towards the ... thing with one
hand and closing one eye. "Ugh ... I can't grab it; it's animate."

"I should get Nagato-san," Koizumi realized aloud, fumbling for his phone. He
hadn't gotten Yuki's cell number yet, but Mori was with the girl, so he could
call her, and--

"Don't be an idiot!" Haruhi yelled, growling with effort as she levitated a
handful of boulders from the slope below them, sending them crashing into the
sand as a low wall to shelter Kanae.

From the beach, Kyon glanced back at the pair of them -- ever so briefly --
then rolled abruptly to one side, narrowly dodging another sand-melting blast
of energy. "What shall I do, then?" Koizumi asked, his phone in one hand.

Haruhi grunted with exertion again, sending dozens of stones from below them
across the beach, leaving Kyon a whole selection of barriers to hide behind.
He wasted no time, immediately diving behind the nearest one and fiddling with
his strange morphing weapon.

Done helping for the moment, though keeping most of her attention on the
creature, she snapped, "Koizumi, you're an esper! Use your powers to help Kyon
out!"

He blinked at her. Did she not understand his limitations? He recalled quite
clearly that he had explained it to her in detail -- with Kyon! And then she
had just ... forgotten? "Suzumiya-san," he began to protest, before she cut
him off, and yet another blast of energy escaped the strange thing on the
beach, "my powers cannot be easily--"

"Shut up!" she yelled, turning her full attention to him for just a moment.
"Kyon needs help, and I can only float things! You're an _esper_, so get out
there and _ESP_!" With that, and no more warning, she shoved him off the edge
of the cliff.

He windmilled for a frantic instant while he hung in midair before gravity
took effect. Had just enough time to realize that if Haruhi hadn't levitated
all of the good footholds out onto the beach, he might be able to jog at a
(literally) break-neck pace. Instead, he was going to tumble painfully onto
the sharp rocks that waited, meters below.

Then he pitched beyond the point of balance and allowed himself the luxury of
resentment for his situation as the stone rushed up at him.

* * *

Society was never Tsuruya's favorite thing. For all of her trouble allowing
people close enough to her to be friends (until recently), she'd had more than
enough of attending events involving high-standing social families -- other
daughters and sons of government officials, famous authors, generic wealthy
people.... The occasional other heirs from ninkyo dantai families, greeting
one another with wary nods of solidarity, hidden in the empty social noise
around them.

To her, that posturing seemed fake, and lacked the delightful _earnestness_ of
interacting with Haruhi, Kyon, and the others. Still, even if she didn't
_like_ it, she did know how she was supposed to behave, and more importantly,
how to dig for information or subtly interrogate someone in polite
conversation. She also didn't know all of the details as to why Mikuru seemed
to dislike Kyouko so much, or why Haruhi seemed agitated by Sasaki.

But Kyon and Haruhi were gone, for the moment, and Kyouko was cowed by Mori.
Kasai was quietly standing by, his sheer stature unspoken menace by itself....
Even buried as he was beneath a pile of sand, thanks to Nonoko and Miyoko.
Aside from that, unless Tsuruya was mistaken, more of her father's men were
already scattered across the beach, just waiting for whatever allies Kyouko
might have to show themselves.

That meant for the moment, she had the superior position.

Well, even if it weren't her favorite thing, it _was_ something she was
skilled at. If she only brought one thing to the brigade that was unique to
her, it wouldn't be so bad if it were just that thing. So, while Kyon and
Haruhi were off with the club's esper and slider, probably dealing with some
_other_ threat, she decided to do her best and occupy Sasaki and Kyouko, and
maybe even get some answers from them.

At a glance, for some reason, Nonoko already seemed very distrusting of
Sasaki. That seemed the best place to start, so:

"Imouto-kun," Tsuruya asked, smiling brightly at Kyon's sister, "do you know
this girl?"

"Nope!" the small girl answered, shaking her head quickly. "But...." She
trailed off hesitantly and shrugged.

"But what?" Sasaki asked, smiling curiously at Nonoko. "I suppose then, Kyon
never mentioned me at all? That's a bit of a sad thought...."

"Oooh!" Tsuruya gasped, eyes widening at Sasaki. "Could it be, this is Kyon-
kun's elusive ex-girlfriends?!"

Sasaki's face colored faintly and she shook her head very quickly. "No,
absolutely not," she replied without hesitation, smiling. "Kyon-kun and I are
merely very good friends."

Such good friends he never talked about her, evidently. "And, how do you know
Kyon-kun?" Tsuruya asked Kyouko.

"W...we've only met a handful of times," the girl with the twin ponytails
said, glancing at Mori fearfully. Was the woman so scary to her...? "I don't
know him well."

"You're quite interested in him for someone who doesn't know him well," Sasaki
jibed, laughing softly at her friend.

"H...he's influential," Kyouko mumbled, shrugging uncomfortably. "I mean ...
not that I'm that type of person. It really would be good if somehow Kyon and
I could become friends, or at least I could get him to trust me more...." She
turned to Sasaki. "If you put in a good word for me, I'm sure that would
happen."

Humming thoughtfully, Tsuruya nodded. Evidently Kyouko thought that Sasaki
could influence Kyon in some way. At a guess, if they were anything close to
friends, Kyon would be able to influence Sasaki in some way, too....

"It becomes difficult when I don't know your true motives," Sasaki replied,
shrugging with an apologetic smile. "While I like to think that Kyon trusts me
enough to take me at my word, I don't know that I could give it without
understanding your own goals better!"

"I have told you!" Kyouko protested. "I've always been honest."

"Kyouko-chan, fantasy stories aren't the truth," Sasaki chided, still smiling.
"And if it's a game, well, I don't understand the rules well enough to play,
and it seems that you're able to play just fine with me being in the dark."

The twin-tailed girl scowled at that, crossing her arms over her chest and
staring out at the sea.

"At any rate," Sasaki continued, turning her attention back to Tsuruya, "I
feel it's safe to say that Kyon hasn't told us of one-another simply because
we've been out of contact. We went to middle school together, and attended the
same cram-school, as well! He came to my house to study a few times, and our
parents got along quite well. It seemed quite abrupt that after middle school,
he stopped speaking to me!

"For a time, I wondered if he'd dropped out of school entirely, and went
straight to work. Maybe he had stopped talking to me because of embarrassment?
But evidently, that was a needless worry; it seems he's just been very busy.
What a surprise for Kyon! But I'm sure once I get a chance to speak to him and
learn this new game he's playing better, we'll be just as good of friends once
more!"

"Ah!" Kyon's little sister gasped suddenly, eyes widening. "It was _you_!" she
accused, pointing a finger at Sasaki, frowning sharply. "You were the one!"

* * *

Even though he had distantly considered Kanae's words from long ago, once he
was actually going toe-to-toe with a giant inter-dimensional slider death
'bot, he really felt that the girl hadn't done the thing justice. From the
first narrowly dodged beam, sending clouds of steam and tracing a trench of
molten sand across the beach, he wished he'd paid more attention -- or at
least asked for more details.

Still, Kanae had _also_ said that the horrible robot things came _last_,
usually. Was this one an exception, possibly related to the other slider
retreating after he lost his weapons? He desperately hoped so, as dozens of
boulders larger than him suddenly flew free of the steep slope on the north
side of the beach, helpfully slamming into the sand and creating barriers.

Kanae was curled into a whimpering ball behind one. With strange insight, he
suddenly looked back towards that long-ago day when he only had to watch the
cave cricket while Mikuru clung to him. And to think, he had felt powerless,
wishing he could do more to fight that monster. Now he realized he wouldn't
have terribly minded having the job of reassuring and comforting Kanae, as he
was busily scrambling to fresh cover and hoping he was distracting the ...
thing. Once he was behind a barrier -- not that he expected it to stop more
than a stray shot or two -- he evaluated the situation.

Except to turn the primary canon feature, which seemed to be a single
elongated gun barrel, the end glowing white with heat, the robot hadn't moved
much. It was six-limbed, and each limb was incredibly slim -- he guessed a
handful of centimeters at the widest point. Each leg was segmented in five
places, and the lines were strange, graceful arches. The body itself, probably
a meter high and two meters around was an ovoid, shaped somewhat like a
teardrop with the pointed end being the glowing weapon barrel.

It was silvery blue, incredibly shiny, and seemed to lack any writing, labels,
or insignia. A handful of other spikes and protrusions surrounded the weapon
barrel in a band along the thing's circumference on a single plane around the
perimeter of the teardrop shape. If he had to guess -- and at the moment, he
did have to -- he would assume they were lesser weapons, sensors, and probably
a variety of tools designed to help inter-dimensional robot death spiders do
... whatever it was they did.

A glance showed him Haruhi and Koizumi, standing at the top of where the slope
of jumbled stones used to be -- in Kyon's mind, dangerously exposed to the
horrible robot monstrosity. "Okay, Skynet," he addressed his PDA, hefting the
new, larger gun that Kuyou had given him, even as the rocks behind him began
to grow uncomfortably warm, "set all weapons to 'distract'."

He'd initially thought the slider's weapon was something he'd never need --
something too powerful for most situations. That thought in mind, he _really_
wished that he'd set options up in advance for disabling robots, instead of a
variety of creative electro-net launchers, sonic stun-weaponry, and other
general settings that reached a level of power designed to irritate and stun
organic beings.

Really, just a solidly dependable _cutting_ laser would be something, but he
didn't have time -- or power -- to play with dozens of settings and energy
types before finally discovering a vulnerability. Hopefully the 'distract'
setting, designed to simply make an overwhelming amount of electrical noise
would blind it. He'd initially thought it would be a clever way to disable
security cameras ... until Yuki pointed out that an overactive camera was more
likely to stand out, and he could turn invisible to conventional electronics
_anyway_.

Well, at least, it wasn't a total loss, now.

If he could keep it busy long enough, hopefully someone who could actually
_stop_ the thing would show up. He was just about to break from cover and take
a potshot at the thing before rolling behind the next barrier when he glanced
to where Koizumi and Haruhi were still standing. He couldn't make out the
details, but it looked like they were arguing....

As exposed as they were, that meant he _really_ had to get out into the line
of fire and distract the stupid robot thing.

* * *

Mikuru finally felt herself get closer to a relaxed stance as she watched the
interplay between Tsuruya and Sasaki. She still really didn't like Kyouko, but
it was foolish of her to get completely caught up in being afraid, even when
she was surrounded by friends and allies. Mori had supposedly been the one to
rescue her when she'd been kidnapped, but Yuki was the one who had woken her
up after she'd been drugged. And _both_ of those people were with her, now ...
so being scared was a waste of time.

She tried to tell herself that, anyway. Tsuruya was taking advantage of the
opportunity, and while she was subtle, she could see the heiress digging for
answers from Sasaki. The other girl was sharp, too, though, and was likely to
catch on. Before Mikuru could contribute, she was startled by Kyon's sister's
accusation.

"I was the one?" Sasaki asked Nonoko, cocking her head slightly to one side.
"I'm not sure I understand...?"

"In middle school, something happened to Kyon-kun," Kyon's sister said
stubbornly, frowning intently at Sasaki. "_Someone_ took away his smile, and
he didn't find it until Haru-nee-san brought it back! That was _you_!"

"I ... made Kyon stop smiling?" Sasaki asked, nearly in a laugh. "Now, now....
Don't be silly! Kyon wouldn't stop smiling just because...." Mikuru watched
her eyes closely as she trailed off, and the amusement in her smile drained
away, leaving a bitter mask behind. "W...well.... It was probably a
coincidence!"

"I think she's with the dark generals," Nonoko judged, nodding.

"Ah, see? That's the kind of stuff you think from watching too many anime, or
reading too much manga! Kyon used to be such a dreamer, reading those stories
all day and spending his time wishing it were real instead of focusing on the
world around us! That's a more positive thing, I think. If I had an effect on
Kyon it would be that-- I wouldn't want to make him unhappy and stop smiling!"

For Mikuru, the alignment of facts was almost painful. Suddenly, so much more
made sense.... Kyon knew this girl in middle school ... and they had spent
time together. Sasaki had made an impression on him, but she was both aware of
it, and had actually tried to encourage Kyon to grow in a different way.
Mikuru could easily imagine the scene. Kyon enduring all of Sasaki's unwelcome
criticism, trying to reshape himself to be her ideal, to get close to her,
chipping away at himself and slowly trading away the things he wanted to
believe in, and in the end....

Did Sasaki know that Kyon had a crush on her? Realistically, seeing how it
played out, and reading Kyon's 'romance' story.... Did _Kyon_ even understand
that was what happened? Maybe _that_ was why he was so generally passive, and
just let the other girls kiss him with minimal resistance, even though she
could tell he felt bad about it. He'd tried to start a relationship with
Sasaki, but she hadn't really returned that affection or rejected him ... so
he came to the conclusion that it couldn't have been real.

Then again, considering Kyon's own ignorance (or feigned ignorance) ... was
that behavior he had learned from Sasaki? Did _Sasaki_ even understand that
she had feelings for Kyon? Mikuru could tell that the girl wanted to speak to
Kyon desperately. But as someone who didn't believe that time travelers,
aliens, or espers were real, how much of the information from that realm could
instill her with a sense of urgency?

And _that_ was what Haruhi had picked up on, and why Sasaki agitated her so
much! Tsuruya was more correct than Sasaki would admit, asking if the supposed
one-time friend were Kyon's ex-girlfriend.

"Um, Sasaki-san," she said, unsure why, but suddenly angry at the idea of the
hurt that Sasaki had heaped on Kyon, "I know you're not close any more, but
did Kyon-kun tell you the latest?"

"I think we're still close," Sasaki countered, shaking her head. "We just
don't talk as much. He still calls me by my first name, after all!"

Mikuru exchanged a glance with Tsuruya, neither girl missing how defensive
Sasaki had been. "Well, the thing of it is, he _has_ had a lot on his mind,"
the time traveler admitted, offering a disingenuous smile. "But then, you
wouldn't have known that Kyon-kun is engaged to Tsuruya!"

Sasaki's reaction tore at Mikuru. On the one hand, she wanted to be pleased at
the hurt in Sasaki's gaze, and validated that her theory were correct.

But on the other hand....

She cared about Kyon herself, so she didn't have to imagine the pain of seeing
Kyon put beyond reach.

"I...is that ... so?" Sasaki managed, still forcing a smile.

"Yep!" Tsuruya confirmed brightly. "Our parents agreed and everything!"

"Tsuru-nee-san is good for Kyon-kun; she makes him laugh," Kyon's sister
opined.

After a thoughtful pause, Miyoko nodded her agreement. "I like Mikuru-nee-san
and Haruhi-nee-san for Kyon-nii-san, too," she added. "But Tsuru-nee-san is
very good for him."

"W...well!" Sasaki exclaimed. "That's ... amazing! Ah, um.... W...well, Kyon
seemed to be busy lately, and I suppose I know why, now!" She shook her head,
grimacing before she masked it with a smoother false smile. "Sorry, I'm a bit
stunned," she allowed, collecting her wits. "Ah ... hum! So ... might I ask
how this came about?" Sasaki hesitated the briefest moment, her glance darting
to Mikuru before fixing on Tsuruya. "Though, now that I think of it, this
engagement is arranged by Kyon's parents, isn't it? He wouldn't make such a
choice on his own, I'd think."

Tsuruya laughed good-naturedly, seeming unfazed by Sasaki's verbal barbs.

"You know Kyon really well!" the heiress remarked, settling down a bit, though
still chuckling. "Hum, you went to middle school with Kyon-kun ... and cram-
school, too! You've known him for almost three years, and I've only gotten so
close to him in just under a year.... Since you know him better, tell me about
how Kyon-kun was in middle school!"

Mikuru found herself simultaneously stifling a giggle at Tsuruya's counter and
blushing sympathetically for the girl with the shorter hair.

Sasaki caught the subtle message, too, and gave a polite smile with a resigned
sigh. At her side, Kyouko merely looked uncomfortable, toying with the edge of
her towel. "Well, as I mentioned, in middle school Kyon was a dreamer," Sasaki
allowed, shrugging. "He was terrible at study, and would gladly spend every
free moment he had playing games or reading his shounen manga."

"Kyon-kun's quite intelligent, I think," Mikuru disagreed with a hesitant
smile, feeling compelled to speak in his defense. "I...if anything, I think he
only lacks strong motivation some times."

"Lately, Kyon-nii-san has been very motivated," Miyoko opined, giggling. "He
was a bit mopey when he took me to see that movie last year, but now he seems
much more upbeat!" She winced at a sudden memory and amended, "Well, until
those boys shot him...."

Sasaki reeled back, blinking. "K...Kyon was ... shot?" she asked,
disbelieving. "I read mention of it in the paper, but I thought-- That was
_Kyon_?!"

"That's right," Mikuru agreed, not particularly enjoying the memory either.
"Um.... But that.... Well, you read about it, right?"

"Y...yes," Sasaki allowed, nodding uneasily. Rallying, she gave a very bright
smile, saying with confidence, "Kyon never did anything to attract such
attention when I knew him!"

Tsuruya caught the implication but seemed to dismiss it easily ... Mikuru
envied her friend's composure concerning Kyon being injured. Then again, Kyon
_himself_ dismissed it, so.... "Mmm, so that's all there was to Kyon, then?"
Tsuruya mused. "You saw him as a lazy dreamer, and...?"

"H...he was creative and clever, he just never applied himself practically,"
Sasaki explained, shrugging. "Naturally, I felt compelled to help him."

Unable to resist, though she worried at the fact she needed her friends around
her to have the confidence to say such a thing, Mikuru asked, "Do you help all
of your friends, that way?"

"I try," Sasaki allowed, nodding.

"So, then, have you helped Tachibana-san become less of the type of person who
would abduct someone off the street?"

Tsuruya raised her eyebrows and turned to study Mikuru. Sasaki looked annoyed,
and Kyouko covered her face with her hands. "I _really_ regret that," she
grumbled. "Because I never hear the end of it!"

"I have to admit I find the question worthwhile," Mori chipped in, looking
vaguely amused.

* * *

The essence of Koizumi's power in closed space -- the key to accessing it, at
least -- had been to push aside his assured facade and reach for the real
emotions he usually hid within. He'd been granted knowledge of the mechanics
along with the power; part of the reason he'd wondered, initially, if he were
losing his mind. By embracing his own emotionality, separate from the feelings
that he picked up from Haruhi, he was able to grasp that ability and slip
sideways ... and then, further, to take power and do battle in that strange
space.

That space that didn't _exist_ anymore, thanks to Kyon. And lately, he
realized, he actually had quite a bit to complain to Kyon about! Granted, Kyon
_may_ have had some justification, and their awkward semi-role-reversal had
been eye-opening, at least. But if it weren't for Kyon's meddling, Koizumi
would still be an esper, would still be placed in the Organization in a role
that trusted him with information, and most importantly, _wouldn't_ be
plummeting towards the rocks below, now given an eerie red cast, as though
foreshadowing the blood that would spill when he impacted.

Until Kyon's actions threw everything into disarray.... As it was, he felt
that sometimes he was the only responsible one in the lot, and everyone else
was just playing around, not taking things seriously enough!

He glared at the rocks below him, still with their red glow, then up the
beach, to where Kyon was alternately blasting the ... enemy ... thing ... with
beams of energy.... Well, really, it didn't seem much different from shining a
flashlight on the robot, for all the good it did. Okay, so it did seem to
distract the robot a bit, but it wasn't proving its value as a _weapon_.

Koizumi rolled his eyes as Kyon dove to yet another barrier, taking cover just
as another blast melted his former hiding place into slag. The boy stole a
glance at Koizumi, and for a heartbeat, Koizumi took solace in the fact that
Kyon stopped to stare, evidently stunned by Koizumi's pending demise. If
Haruhi hadn't just _shoved him off a cliff_....

The moment of staring dragged on, and Koizumi frowned, realizing that
something was very wrong. The distraction grew, and Kyon squinted, as though
not believing-- Too long; until that moment, he'd been active, moving from
cover to cover.

The hesitation grew, and this time, the beam of rock-melting energy ate
through Kyon's protective barrier, making contact with the boy-- Everything
happened at once, then. Kyon's entire body illuminated, as though he were
glowing within, and he suddenly launched along the beam's path, flying across
the beach. From the cliff-top above him, Koizumi heard Haruhi's indignant cry
of fury, as more giant boulders tore themselves free from his inevitable
impact site, straight below and....

...and....

...and it was taking a very long time to fall, wasn't it? He stared with
confusion as the boulders Haruhi had levitated were vaporized by the robot as
they shot toward it, one-by-one.

It wasn't until the echo of Haruhi's anger through his connection with her
reached him that Koizumi realized he was _floating_. Wrapped in a dim aura of
crimson energy, just hanging in space and feeling _sorry_ for himself while
his friends fought--

But he knew how to use his powers; aside from being granted knowledge on how
to use them, he'd had years of practice.

With a sense of growing determination, he accelerated directly at the robot,
allowing his body to explode into flame and light. As energy, when the next
shot from the robot went not towards Haruhi, who had flung the boulders, but
directly through him, he ignored it, feeling the surges of power through the
red force that was his being.

A sharpening of will and intent; he deflected narrowly to one side of the
robot, allowing the thinnest, keenest edge of his emotion to slash at the hulk
in passing, almost as though he had banked and skimmed the surface of the
splayed legs. With more resistance than a Shinjin, but not enough considering
the thing's spindly limbs, he severed the three on the thing's left side and
shot past it, curving away. He had already plotted out the next move, smoothly
sliding into it; a short, hard arc up into the air before looping back to meet
with the robot again.

At the apex of his flight, angling down, he felt joy -- and then a resonance
of the same, more intense, from Haruhi. Improbably, despite just being hit
with a beam of energy that melted rocks and sand, Kyon emerged from a glowing
indentation in the rock wall, his greatcoat smoking as it cast off excess heat
energy. The robot awkwardly turned to face Kyon's next barrage of distracting
blasts, scrabbling around with the three functioning legs remaining as the
bulk of its mass dug into the sand beneath it.

Perfect, Koizumi realized, reshaping his energy into a piercing spike as he
bore down towards the center of the thing's carapace.

He _felt_ the thing's innards as the carapace cracked, strange fluids and
mechanical parts, glowing structures of pure energy right next to more easily
recognized pistons and cables ... but it couldn't run with him tearing through
it, crimson energy slashing and shattering as much as possible before
Koizumi's awareness broke through the bottom of the defeated robot, spreading
his volume out into a cloud and arresting his momentum just above the crashing
surf.

Though his greatcoat was still smoking, he limped slightly, and he seemed to
have a small nick over one eye, Kyon strode towards the robot with a scowl.
Koizumi gathered the scarlet force that comprised his being from where it had
billowed out around the fallen robot like a fiery crimson fog and re-assumed
his own form. In his own body, he floated to one side of the fallen enemy's
unmoving gun-barrel before he allowed himself to drift to the beach and
dismissed his aura of power.

"Nice work," Kyon judged, his voice a bit raspy as he gave the esper a
grudging nod.

"Thank you," Koizumi replied cheerfully. "I'm glad I can be of service to
you." Trite as it might have been, he was, too.

"Hey!" Haruhi shouted, waving from the distant cliff-top. "Heeeeey!"

"I'll check on Kanae-chan, you help Haruhi get down here," Kyon decided,
glancing at the network of molten sand channels on the beach.

"Certainly, vice commander!" Koizumi chirped. Somehow, despite all his
previous frustration ... he really couldn't help but think that he would be
happier with this latest development. Now, maybe, he wouldn't feel like he had
been left behind; with that kind of reassurance, maybe he could see why the
others didn't seem as concerned.

* * *

"I don't believe I'm accountable for the actions of my friends," Sasaki
finally decided in answer to Mikuru's question. "I appreciate that Kyouko-chan
and Fujiwara-kun believe I'm influential, but to be honest, I don't see myself
like that. I'm occasionally _told_ that I have 'vast power and influence', but
I find that unlikely; what could I influence that's beyond my reach?"

Nonoko thought that sounded like classic dark general double-talk, a very
standard, "I can't be held accountable for things I've caused!" dismissal of
responsibility if she ever heard one!

It was confusing, though, because even though she had determined that she
didn't like Sasaki's effects on her brother, the older girl didn't feel _bad_,
not genuinely. Then again, the forces of evil liked to prey on borderline
cases ... it was _possible_ that Sasaki might be redeemed, somehow, but in
order to do that, they would need to find out which dark force had corrupted
her.

Then, Kyon could take down that enemy, and Sasaki's potential good could be
restored! Of course ... in order to do that, they'd need to investigate. She
wasn't certain where to start such a search, herself, but Mikuru and Tsuruya
seemed to have a good idea, and Mori was helping, too.

While she and Miyoko were aware of the hidden messages in the older girls'
words, neither could decipher them. Whatever they were, they stung Sasaki,
though. Even though the mysterious dark-influenced girl smiled and laughed,
Nonoko was confident that she wasn't nearly as happy inside.

That worried her, though.... If Kyon were the only one who could redeem her,
what if it was a trap? She'd need to think about that and make sure that
Tsuruya or someone equally dependable was there to help him out when it
happened. As long as she could warn her brother not to face Sasaki alone, he
should be okay, she decided. Until they knew more, at least.

"Well, that's a differences between friends and subordinates," Tsuruya
remarked, shrugging. "Though, you _do_ considers Tachibana-kun here to be a
friend, and not a subordinate, so then, does that mean that while she's your
friend, she's a subordinate of Fujiwara-san?" Nonoko noticed Tsuruya's more
polite name for the servant of the dark generals; good, the heiress knew that
he was more sinister than he even appeared.

Sasaki raised her eyebrows at that, giving Kyouko a contemplative look. For
her part, the twin-tailed girl shifted her shoulders and looked very
uncomfortable under the scrutiny -- even more so than before.

"Why so nervous?" Mori asked, reaching into one of the nearby picnic baskets.
"Hmm, Asahina-chan, shouldn't we offer our guests something to drink? Perhaps
we're not being the best company...."

"Ah," Mikuru and Tsuruya breathed together, ducking their heads and giggling
awkwardly.

"That's true," the heiress allowed, nodding. "Sorries! This discussions got a
bit heavy, didn't it?"

"Y...yes," Mikuru agreed. "Um, I made watermelon tea; would you like some?"
She pulled out a thermos, while Mori produced a small stack of disposable
cups.

"Certainly," Sasaki allowed. "Thank you. But it only seems natural that as we
become older, our discussions must become more serious, though."

Kasai suddenly snorted, then coughed, covering his mouth with one hand and
dislodging a good portion of the sand pile he was buried beneath as he tried
very hard to hide a grin. "Sand," he said, by way of apology, ducking when
everyone turned to glance at him.

"So, how does one make tea from watermelon, anyway?"

Frowning at the distraction, Nonoko tuned out the other girls for the moment,
realizing as she turned back that Yuki was missing.

* * *

Her eyes fluttered open, and the first thing she saw was her sempai's face.
Her ears rung, and her back was slightly sore, like she had fallen recently.
But the sun was behind his head, giving him a brilliant golden halo, and she
could smell the sea.

This was easily her favorite dream, despite the less important details being
off. He mouthed something at her, looking down in concern, but she only heard
the ringing. She shook her head happily, knowing that here, at least, words
weren't important.

So, she reached up and kissed him.

It wasn't quite right at first. For one thing, he was wearing his greatcoat,
instead of no shirt at all. For another, instead of magically teleporting the
pair of them to a shadowy wooded glade surrounded by bunnies and flowers, they
stayed on the beach. He was holding her mostly right, but she could feel
grains of sand in his hair from where she was holding his head.... But the
kiss was the stranger part; it felt firmer, somehow more real, but not nearly
as good as she had expected.

Then something happened, as though her sempai were merely surprised at the
kiss, and only just then remembered to kiss her back, and everything was
starting to feel right -- even better than alright. The outside world with
Koizumi staring at her in amazement and Haruhi silently yelling at her began
to melt away, and--

She broke the kiss suddenly, crying out, "Bwa~! Uh! Uh! Um, sorry!" She was
curled in on herself, or trying to, still held in her sempai's arms. Her
hearing abruptly returned, and she cringed even further at Haruhi's tirade.

"--idn't have a camera ready! That demands a do-over, and, and--"

"Wait, what?" her sempai interrupted, giving Haruhi an incredulous stare
before suddenly shaking his head with a grimace. "No, actually, never mind
that now! We just fought an inter-dimensional ... robot ... _thing_," he said,
still holding Kanae close.

"Right, right," Haruhi grumbled, calming, crossing her arms over her chest and
shaking her head. "Okay, I lost perspective there; the important thing was
that you were trying to comfort Kanae-chan, which totally makes sense." She
took a very deep breath, then turned to Koizumi, who was frozen at her side
with a look of mild horror. "You, snap out of it," she commanded. "We need to
hold it together."

"Yes," the esper rasped, shaking his head quickly and straightening his
posture. "Yes," he said again, more clearly. "I'll-- Ah, hello, Nagato-san."

He eyed the girl suspiciously. Wait, Yuki had been there, too, able to see
Kanae's blunder? Oh, how many witnesses were there?! She had not only
embarrassed herself by not pulling it off nearly as impressively as Mikuru,
she'd done it with everyone _watching_!? They should have spied discreetly,
with hidden security cameras, or clever use of amazing powers!

Haruhi stood not far away, between Kanae and the beach leading to the steep
ramp -- though, those boulders seemed to have been scattered around aimlessly,
and many of them had evidently melted, some still faintly glowing. The brigade
chief ignored the recent signs of battle, just tapping a foot with poorly
concealed impatience and staring at Kyon expectantly. Koizumi was right next
to her, recovering his bearings and surrounded with the faintest glimmering
halo of crimson flame.

Closer to the tide line, Yuki stood, facing Kanae's sempai, but with her head
turned towards the sea. Kanae was the merest instant away from shrieking in
alarm and jumping from her sempai's supporting embrace when her eyes caught
the remains of one of the strange curved metal constructs she recognized; the
target of Yuki's focus.

She gasped in surprise, suddenly remembering; the first of her enemy sliders
had appeared.... But the same sempai that was still holding her in his arms
had -- somehow -- fought him off. And with the aid of his friends, even beaten
one of the horrible machines.

Her face overheating with alarm as everything caught up with her at once, she
was strongly tempted to just kiss her sempai again. She managed to resist,
barely, squeaking out, "I'm sorry!"

"It's not.... No, that's fine, Kanae-chan," he replied, shaking his head, his
face colored. "U...um, as long as you're okay."

"God, she's _cute_ like that, though," Haruhi exclaimed, grabbing Kanae away
from her sempai suddenly. Kanae allowed another squeak of alarm to escape as
the older girl held her tightly and twirled around. "I want to take her
_home_!"

Kanae couldn't actually bring herself to complain; she knew she should have
let go of her sempai, but she was reassured by Haruhi's embrace, too. Even if
it was a bit of an embarrassing reminder, what with Haruhi's enviable
endowments pressing into her back.

"Yes, that's very cute," Koizumi agreed. As her sempai climbed to his feet and
dusted the sand from his greatcoat, the esper added, "Kyon, there's something
I'd like to speak with you about when you have a moment."

"Before I forget," Haruhi remarked, settling down, but still clutching the
smaller girl to herself, "after you got over your shock, that was some very
nice work, Koizumi! As expected of an experienced esper!"

"Thank you," the boy allowed, inclining his head slightly, wearing his usual
smile.

"You did alright, Kyon, but as it goes, you let yourself get completely
outshone by your sidekick," Haruhi continued, shaking her head. "But, enough
of that. Let's prioritize."

"Sidekick," Kyon said flatly, grabbing the edges of his greatcoat flaps and
snapping the fabric once -- instantly causing it to seem to shift color and
shrink into the shirt Kyon had worn previously, as the skinsuit flowed into
his wristwatch almost instantaneously. Improbably, he tucked the weapon he had
gotten from the slider into the interior of his shirt. Except, it wasn't
really a shirt, she supposed. Haruhi seemed somewhat impressed, too, right
until Kyon fumbled the wooden sword handle from his coat pocket, anyway.

"U...um," Kanae murmured.

"Yes, of course," Koizumi said after a moment, nodding. "That only makes
sense. So, then, Suzumiya-san, what's the first order of business?"

"Yuki-chan, any good salvage from the enemy?" Haruhi asked swiveling Kanae
around to face the quiet girl.

Yuki nodded faintly, gesturing for her sempai to hand her the sword handle
before he could tuck it back into his shirt. "Ah," he said sagely,
surrendering the item to her. "I think I know where this gets used."

Reaching her hand into the giant remains of the robot on the shore, the small
girl grabbed something and twisted-- The mass of the thing folded away like
some strange piece of silver origami, until nothing was left but a glimmering
shard of light too intense to look at. A heartbeat later it was hidden in
Yuki's closed fist. The machine was gone, and Yuki's gaze turned to Haruhi
questioningly.

"Yeah, I think we agreed Kyon needed an energy blade of some kind," Haruhi
said. Kanae didn't need to look back to see it; she could hear the grin in the
other girl's voice.

Yuki nodded faintly in acknowledgement, bringing her closed fist together with
the sword handle in her hand; there was another bright surge of light, and the
sword handle was restored, now tightly wrapped with a metallic glinting silver
cord. The small girl wordlessly offered the thing to Kanae's sempai, who
accepted it cautiously.

"I already know how to use a sword, but I'll learn how this thing works
tonight," he decided, tucking it away. "But I'm guessing that if we face
another one of those, I can also tune some of the other weapons against them?"

"Hold up-- Other weapons?" Haruhi asked, frowning. "I thought you had the gun
and the sword! What all equipment have you collected while I wasn't in the
party?"

"In a moment," her sempai countered, shaking his head. "First of all, we have
to cover this beach up before someone else comes along."

"Good point," Haruhi acquiesced. "So we'll try and restore it to just like it
was before the fight."

"Program loaded," Yuki acknowledged.

"Permission granted," Kyon agreed quickly.

Kanae was slowly spun in place by Haruhi as the sand cooled and flowed to its
previous shapes, now softly rolling curves and dunes instead of scored
trenches and gouges. The boulders rolled back to the slope, silently stacking
themselves in their original formation. In the course of half a minute, there
was no sign left that the battle had taken place -- save for her sempai's
weariness.

"Right," her sempai agreed, adjusting his shirt, flicking it back into a
greatcoat. It looked a _tiny_ bit silly with his trunks on beneath, but Kanae
could not deny the practicality; he'd needed it earlier, after all. Coughing,
and then dropping into a faux movie announcer voice, he declared, "Skynet, my
absolutely loyal and trustworthy electronic companion." As he named it, he
flicked his PDA out, leaving it to flip in place in the air before him. "First
and slightly smaller gun," he boomed, setting out one of the two metal
cylinders, then saying in a more normal voice, "I really should name these
two."

"Wah! Don't drop character!" Haruhi protested, squeezing Kanae. "That was just
getting awesome!"

Her sempai quirked one eyebrow, then readjusted his stance, posing slightly.
Suddenly, the bare-chest and open-coat look didn't seem _silly_ at all, and
Kanae wondered if Haruhi was holding her more tightly to keep her from trying
to rush him. The temptation was very real. Using the announcer voice again, he
continued, "Other, newly acquired gun." Now two cylinders floated in the air,
the PDA slightly to one side. "Beam-cutter-weapon thing," he added,
contributing the sword to the pile.

"Ugh! You _do_ need better names for the rest of your equipment!"

"Just be glad I'm humoring you this far," he warned in his normal voice.
"Actually, I think I should be a lot more alarmed by the fact that I was
almost vaporized by an alien beam weapon."

Haruhi's embrace tightened the slightest bit. "Well, Kanae-chan helped you get
your mind off that, but you look _fine_ considering how much you worried us!
Except, you're really blowing the whole inventory. Anyway, what else?"

"The skinsuit and gravity thingies," her sempai grumbled, shaking his head.

"Well, that seems quite sufficient," Koizumi said, spreading his hands in a
shrug. "Now, are there any objections to returning to our base of operations
for the beach expedition? We've been gone long enough; we can discuss today's
battle later with the others."

"Alright," Haruhi agreed reluctantly, while Kyon shifted his outfit out of
combat mode, stowing all of his gadgets in the hidden pockets. "You know,
Kyon, I did say you'd need a lot of tools, but I didn't intend to turn you
into a lombax!"

"I don't have a wise-cracking robotic sidekick," he remarked, as Haruhi
finally released Kanae. "I've got Koizumi."

The esper looked slightly puzzled. "I'm not sure I catch the reference?" he
asked cautiously, falling into step just behind Kanae's sempai.

Yuki watched the pair in silence, then moved to walk at Kanae's side, Haruhi
just behind them. "So, anyway," Haruhi said in a quiet voice while Koizumi
listened to the other boy's explanations about some game, "did you manage to
record the kiss, Yuki-chan?"

"Yes," Yuki answered without hesitation.

"Perfect!"

Just when things had finally calmed down, and Kanae had a minute to try and
sort things out -- Haruhi had brought up that embarrassing not-a-dream again!
"Oh..." she whimpered, her face reddening.

* * *

She shrugged, still smiling politely, despite the cold reactions of Kyon's
friends, and the inexplicable pain in her chest at the announcement of Kyon's
engagement. It must be shock, she told herself, shock that something so
unusual and unexpected would happen to Kyon, who had always longed for such
strange events. She should be happy for him, but somehow ... she couldn't help
but feel that something was not _right_ about the green-haired girl.

Aside from a suspicion that she couldn't prove that somehow it was by
associating with _her_ that Kyon had gotten embroiled in violence. Her or
Haruhi, at any rate. Though they had similar personalities, there was
something _else_ she couldn't name that bothered her about Haruhi.

Was Kyon in trouble because of them? He let himself be pushed around so
easily, Sasaki thought it was entirely possible he'd been deceived into
getting involved with something more dangerous than he could handle.

That made it that much more important that she tried to talk to him. And
lately, she'd had such a hard time getting through to Kyon, she had a feeling
that if she put it off, he'd be married to Tsuruya, and then they'd _never_
get a chance to talk. She felt uncomfortable at the sense of urgency that
inspired within her.

But all of that was allowing herself to be distracted from the current
situation. Unfortunately, that mostly seemed to consist of being grilled by
Kyon's new associates. Sipping at the cool watermelon 'tea' (really, it was
just watermelon juice), she decided to try and change the subject. "So," she
said, smiling at Kyon's presumed sibling. Kyon had mentioned having a sister,
but Sasaki had never met her. Since Miyoko was a friend, that meant the
youngest looking girl with her hair in a side-pony-tail was her. "You are
Kyon's sister, is that right?"

"Yeah," the girl agreed, eyeing her warily. "Have we met?"

"Not yet! But it seems you have a bad impression of me, for some reason. I
wouldn't want to come across as unlikeable, so, was it something I did that
bothers you?"

"You took away Kyon's smile," she protested, pouting.

"You said that before," Sasaki said slowly, her own smile slipping. "That...."
Had she inadvertently hurt Kyon's feelings that much worse than she had
realized, with that final deconstruction? "Hmm. If I ever did, then I assure
you I never meant to," she swore to the smaller girl. "Obviously I think
highly of Kyon, or I wouldn't consider him a friend! I hope he still considers
me a friend, as well, so I wouldn't want to do that!"

"But, you said you changed him," the girl countered, shaking her head.

Sasaki considered it, and realized the smaller girl's point of view. "Y...you
think that was hurtful to Kyon? But, no," she insisted, shaking her head. "He
never.... I...." Ultimately, she would be lying if she hadn't considered the
possibility of failing to meet her ideal of being a supportive, encouraging
friend.... And that was the same reason she could never accept the claims of
her other friends.

Such power as her new friends claimed she had -- it could only be possessed by
a truly infallible being. It was inconceivable that it genuinely existed ...
unless, somehow, only she had ever been given that power in the history of
man. And that was so unlikely that she couldn't really consider it; it was on
the level of gravity suddenly reversing for just one object. No, she was just
a normal high school girl who had not been the friend she had tried to be, and
then gotten entangled in something she shouldn't have.

Still ... even if things were strained, she was confident that with proper
time to discuss things with Kyon and explain her side of the situation, she
could at the very least apologize to him. If she was lucky, she could make
things up to him -- perhaps by helping him out with whatever his present
difficulties were.

In the meantime, everyone was staring at her, waiting for her to finish her
statement. "Ah, well, as I said, I never intended to have any negative effects
on him," she told Kyon's sister. Straightening, but still focused on the
little girl -- though the words were more intended for Tsuruya -- she added,
"My intent has always been to help Kyon, perhaps protect him from the worst of
the world."

Influence over reality indeed.... Lately, Kyouko's strange associates had
already given her enough trouble; sometimes, she wished she really _did_ have
some power.

"It's always good to mean well," Tsuruya finally said, though it sounded
faintly doubtful. "But this is heavy conversations again. So, anyway --
Imouto-kun, don't be so angry at Sasaki-san for Kyon-kun; Kyon-kun isn't mad
at her, after all."

"There's that, at least," Sasaki allowed, forcing a weak smile. Kyon was not a
person who was prone to anger or violent action, in her experience -- not
counting the encounter with Fujiwara earlier that day, but Fujiwara and Kyouko
had cooked up a scheme that explained that. Yet, for some reason, she was
still afraid that he might be upset or unhappy with her. Surely their
friendship hadn't somehow become that badly damaged?

"...and then, the planet blows up," his voice came suddenly, as though to
underscore that thought. She managed a more genuine, if awkward smile at the
sight of him walking back to the beach towels with his friend, the boy Kyouko
had problems with. Kanae, Haruhi and Yuki -- when had she left? -- were
walking behind the boys, the younger girl looking very nervously at the cell
phone carried in Yuki's hand, for whatever reason.

"I see," Koizumi remarked, frowning. "I'm afraid I don't have enough time to
play video games like that often, myself, but perhaps at some point...." He
trailed off and shrugged.

"Eh, I've only got a decade old console myself," Kyon answered dourly, before
he turned to regard the group still camped out beneath the beach umbrellas,
and raised one hand in greeting. "Hey, everyone."

"We're back," Koizumi added, offering a polite wave.

After everyone echoed the greeting, as the returnees were sitting back down,
Sasaki asked, "So, how was your mission to find something amazing?"

"I found something!" Koizumi said cheerfully. "But I feel that Kyon has made
the greater discoveries."

"What did you find?" Sasaki prompted Kyon, curious, but wishing she could talk
about the things she really needed to, instead.

"Got attacked by a slider," he answered, accepting a cup of watermelon tea
from Mikuru. "Then a giant alien robot death thingy. Suou-san and your
sneering bastard friend teleported in and helped out, and the enemy slider ran
off, leaving the robot behind. Then I ran around and dodged like crazy until
Koizumi used his esper powers to cut it up."

"Is that all?" Sasaki giggled, as everyone else stared at Kyon, evidently
unprepared for his joke.

"Mostly dodged," Haruhi chimed in, suddenly, rolling her eyes. "Our clumsy
vice commander let himself get zapped by an energy beam of some kind!"

"And that really stung, too," Kyon agreed, giving a weary shake of his head as
he sighed.

"So, you're just a normal person, and your friends all helped out?" Sasaki
asked. "Didn't you contribute anything?"

"Well, I distracted the enemy, and claimed spoils of war.... But you know me;
I'm the wit. I just stood around and made clever remarks, like mentioning that
I did get a weapon that is similar to, but probably legally distinct from a
light-saber," he said, nodding solemnly before sipping at his juice. "The
melonade is excellent, Asahina-san," he added, turning to give the older girl
something very slightly more than a grateful smile.

"Aw," his sister protested, frowning. "Kyon with a sword isn't as cute
fighting the forces of darkness!"

"But swords are awesome," Miyoko noted, giggling. "And Kyon-nii-san is still a
boy, after all, right?"

"Yes," Kanae added, her face coloring darkly. "Um, but then, that's obvious,
and I'll just be quiet now."

"Ah!" Tsuruya exclaimed, eyes opening further, her grin widening. "Good for
you, Kanae-chan!"

"What's this, then?" Kyouko asked, giving Tsuruya a doubtful look.

"Nothing, nothing," Tsuruya answered, shaking her head. "Hum, Haru-nyan, do
you think anyone will beat Kyon-kun and Kanae-chan's discovery?"

"Probably not today," Haruhi replied after a thoughtful moment. "So,
investigations were a success! Great job, everyone! That means the rest of our
time is assigned to having fun! So, what should we do?"

"Well, seeing as it's the beach, I think we should at least go swimming,"
Kyouko suggested quickly.

"Me, I'm worn out from the exploration," Kyon demurred, shaking his head. "I
might even try to take a nap."

Sasaki resisted the urge to sigh.... Whatever Kyon had actually been doing,
despite his stories of sliders and robots, he really _did_ look worn out.
Talking to him today probably wasn't going to happen, especially considering
how difficult it would be to arrange time alone with him. Well, she had her
appointment with him, at least. "I'll see you around, Kyon," she decided,
giving him her best warm smile and adding a tiny bow as she rose. "Kyouko and
I are going to find a spot a bit closer to the water, and maybe find Kuyou, so
take care!"

"You take care, too," he called, as she and Kyouko were heading away.

At least, despite what his sister had said, he didn't seem upset with her.

She thought that Kyon watched her until she lost sight of him, picking through
the other spots on the beach until stumbling across Kuyou, standing in waves
that reached to her knees, her expression curiously blank as she stared at a
pair of children splashing in the water a few yards up the beach. The children
seemed oblivious to Kuyou's scrutiny. Sasaki wondered why it was no one seemed
to find Kuyou's behavior strange, or to notice her, really.

"There you are," Sasaki finally called, waving slightly to her friend. Hadn't
it seemed that Kyon was on better terms with her? He didn't care for Fujiwara,
though that seemed somewhat justified, and he was very wary of Kyouko, which
was entirely justified, so.... "You know, Kyon mentioned you being helpful to
him in his quest earlier?" she teased, wondering what the quiet girl was
thinking.

As Sasaki spoke, Kuyou straightened slowly and turned to face her, eyes
darkening, but betraying no emotion, only greater focus.

"Are you at least getting on anyone's good side?" Kyouko asked, somewhat
testily. "It seems the lot of them despise us, now, except for you and
Sasaki."

"Us," Kuyou echoed, blinking once, very slowly.

Sasaki was slightly alarmed, wondering if that was the first time Kuyou had
blinked since turning to look at her. Surely that couldn't be the case? It
must simply have seemed that way.... "Well, never mind about that," Sasaki
said, striding into the water, gasping at the cold as it rushed up to her
ankles and splashed along her legs. "Ah! Cold! Anyway, Kuyou-chan, I should
warn you ... Kyon is engaged to that green-haired girl, Tsuruya ... I offer
you my consolation!"

"Consolation," Kuyou repeated, tilting her head very slightly, then turning to
look past Sasaki, towards where Kyon's friends were all still camped out. Not
that she'd be able to see them through the other umbrellas and beach-goers.

"Sometimes I wonder how much she really understands," Kyouko sighed, shaking
her head and crossing her arms over her chest.

Something in Kuyou's eyes changed, and her gaze went back to Sasaki. "Meaning
of 'engaged'?" she asked.

"I...it means they're going to get married," Sasaki clarified, wondering what
kind of sheltered life Kuyou must lead. "Um ... that they will try to spend
the rest of their lives together, and probably have children?"

The focus in Kuyou's gaze seemed to change once more, though Sasaki couldn't
quite gauge how. "Sympathy," she remarked.

"Yes, that's right," Sasaki agreed. "I'm sympathetic to you.... You had a
crush on Kyon, didn't you?"

"My luminosity curves to the well of his being; his presence quells the voids
in the fabric of my awareness," Kuyou said, giving another of her incredibly
slow blinks before turning to regard the two children again. Still oblivious
to her, they continued splashing, a little boy and a girl, both giggling
wildly while parents from the shore chatted and watched over them
protectively.

Sasaki was positive that was the longest speech she'd ever heard from her
friend, as well as the most elaborate thing she'd tried to put to words.
"Um.... Well, as I said, you have my sympathy, but Kyon's engaged to Tsuruya,
now. Are you still going to pursue him, though, even in the face of that?"

"You know," Kyouko interrupted, shaking her head and giving Sasaki a wary
stare, "I'm not entirely sure that it's a crush that Kuyou's talking about,
here."

"His influence," she said, before making one of her strange pauses, "me to
him. I am," and another pause, almost identical to the first.

Not for the first time, Sasaki suspected that Kyon could read more out of
those silences than she could. Sighing, she said, "Well, as long as you don't
mean to hurt him or make him an enemy, then you'll have my full support."

For some reason, Sasaki thought that Kuyou looked the slightest bit doubtful,
but her attention shifted so some distant point in the sea, possibly beyond
the horizon.
