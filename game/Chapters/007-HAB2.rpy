    "\"Okay,\" he agreed, as she opened the changing room door for him and bowed yet again. He wondered briefly how quickly Tsuruya had washed ... she'd gotten cut on her wrist, too, but hopefully not very badly. The surgeon had probably taken care of her first; he'd have to ask her about it later, he decided, shutting the door on the maid and quickly stripping.
