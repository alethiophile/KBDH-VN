    "On Michikyuu Kanae's home world, when she was ten years old, a cataclysm had torn a hole in the sky. Strange sleek metallic things had rained down upon the city in her hometown, hatching into gracefully curved reflective metal creatures, no two quite alike, but all very spindly. All very fast, and quite dangerous."
    "Her friends had revealed to her then that she was a locus of power of some kind, and that she had to learn to use her gift and flee from the aliens. They had labored for months to keep her powers secret, even from herself, but with the invasion, there had been no choice. In desperation, not knowing if she could ever come back, she'd finally made the step â€” her first leap."
    nvl clear
    "Landing awkwardly in an alley in an unfamiliar city, her clothes torn and face smudged, not knowing how far her pursuers were from her, she cried for help ... and was answered. A friendly boy claimed he had known her from their elementary school, even though she didn't recognize him. He cleaned her scrapes and cuts, then led her to an unfamiliar school, where teachers insisted they knew her, and then she waved farewell to that kind older boy and was reunited with the parents who she knew, even though her memories didn't match up with theirs."
    nvl clear
    "Over the following weeks, she finally found out the boy's name, but by then, 'Sempai' had become ingrained in her way of thinking, and when everything else seemed strange, he at least listened. He smiled, sometimes he laughed and shook his head, and she doubted he believed ... but when no one else would, he {i}listened{/i}. So, afraid that those strange, sleek invaders from the sky would appear again, she decided to try and search for someone who could help her find what she needed to save her home, and maybe someone who could help her find her way there."
    nvl clear
    "Sometimes her sempai believed her, and sometimes he didn't. A few times, he told her he was an esper, and they weren't so different. Sometimes, and those were the worst, he wasn't anywhere in the world she could find. A few times, he said he knew aliens, time travelers, and a smaller handful of times, demons and other, stranger things. As the weeks turned into months, and then the months turned into years, she watched as in world by world, his attention shifted to other things, and he warned her away from the strange girl that had appeared by him frequently. In those worlds, he almost always believed her, but said he was powerless to help."
    "She had long ago lost count of how many worlds she'd been in, how many history tests she'd failed for remembering things correctly ... but differently. That didn't matter to her, though; in the end, he {i}always{/i} listened, and because of that, across countless worlds, Sempai was Sempai."
