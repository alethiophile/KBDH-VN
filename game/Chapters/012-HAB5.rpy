    "\"They don't sound familiar,\" he said, hoping Yuki wasn't staring at him as he dropped his trousers and stepped into the jet-black gakuran pants.

    "Tsuruya said something else that was muffled, as he pulled his shirt and undershirt off, reaching for their replacements. A moment later, she said, \"Sorries. It's written like 'top of the day', but it can also read 'above the gutter'. It's the delinquent capital of our city!\""

He'd gotten his wish, and ended up with a glance of Yuki wearing nothing more visible to him than a skirt and simple white bra before she finished pulling the blouse on with mechanical precision. But his attention was taken by Tsuruya, and Yuki's eyes were riveted on the taller girl as well. Tsuruya had put her hair up into a bun, and was currently wearing the matching sailor uniform to the outfit Kyon hadn't finished putting on yet."

    "She had tugged the uniform's collar very loose, and rolled up the sleeves. \"There's a towel by my feet,\" she said, holding a jar of some strange orange cream in one hand, the other hand already covered in it. \"Can you tuck it into my collar? I don't want to get this on my disguise.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Er, sure,\" he managed, feeling a bit embarrassed, but doing as she requested, wrapping the towel around her shoulders and then tucking it into her collar. She flashed him a bright smile in gratitude, and then began slathering the orange cream across her exposed skin."
    "\"Nn.... I'll need some help around my eyes and on my face,\" she added, grimacing. \"Nagato-chi, can you help me out, too?\""

    "\"W...what exactly are you doing?\" Kyon finally asked, spotting a hand-mirror in the pile of discarded clothing and accessories by Tsuruya's feet, and holding it up for her. \"Are you trying to look like a ganguro girl?\" He shuddered at the idea of Tsuruya in that imagery. Fake tan, huge white circles around her eyes, bleached blonde hair, makeup caked on thickly.... He found it precisely as attractive as a sumo wrestler in full kabuki makeup."
    nvl clear

Tsuruya closed her eyes and pursed her lips very hard, but with Yuki's precise, delicate touch, it was done almost instantly. Once the makeup ... or whatever it was ... Kyon wasn't certain and decided he didn't really need to know ... was evenly layered on, it began to fade from too- bright orange, to colors that more closely resembled a tan."
    nvl clear
    "Tsuruya made a few faces, then shook her head. \"I hate this stuffs,\" she said primly. \"But it should work. Now, Kyon-kun, can you get on your knees?\""

    "She gave him a curious look before her smile emerged from the tanning solution and she chuckled, shaking her head. \"I have to do your hair,\" she explained, wiping her hands clean on the towel around her neck."
    nvl clear
    "\"Oh,\" he said, feeling his face color as he obediently knelt before her. She plucked some gel and a comb from the mess at her feet, and he held still while she brushed something through his hair and toyed with it for what seemed to be several minutes — long enough for his lower legs to start protesting."

    "\"Done,\" she said, flashing him a grin and gesturing to the mirror he was still holding. With no small amount of trepidation, he tilted it up to see what she had done."

    "\"Oh, wow,\" he managed, impressed at the ruffian staring back at him. \"I look greasier than Taniguchi!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Interesting,\" Yuki agreed. His hair had been slicked back, only to break into a number of sharp-looking spikes. When he tried his normal dour expression, he found the newly stylized hair gave it a fresh aura of menace and impending violence."
    nvl clear
    "Yuki turned to watch as Tsuruya finished rubbing tanning solution into her arms and legs, then removed the towel from her shoulders and rolled her sleeves down. She twirled slowly, lifting her skirt slightly. \"I miss any spots?\" she asked, flashing Kyon a smile."
    nvl clear
    "\"Ah....\" He swallowed his apprehension and looked closely. \"I don't see any,\" he said, shrugging. He grabbed the heavy shirt from the floor and put it on, debating buttoning it up at all. He eventually decided to leave it completely unbuttoned, and the shirt beneath un-tucked. Tsuruya gave a nod of approval, then finished applying some last minute makeup touches — lipstick, eyeliner, and a pair of dangling clip-on earrings."
    nvl clear
    "Yuki didn't say anything or change her expression, but Kyon got the distinct feeling that she felt somehow left out. He studied her for a minute, trying to think what she could do to modify her own image to be more delinquent-like, finally spotting the answer in his own original 'disguise' bundle."
    nvl clear
    "It was the traditional cadet's cap to go with a uniform like his own, black cloth with a short, hard bill. As per delinquent style on males, it was supposed to have a wedge cracked clean off the bill, allowing someone to pull it low and see through the crack, hiding some of the rest of their face. This one was intact, and Kyon didn't see much point in putting a cap on over his spiked hair. He adjusted the band, and then while Yuki blinked, set it on her head."

    "She held perfectly still while he shifted the cap around and found the perfect angle. Low, shadowing her eyes a little bit. \"Nice!\" Tsuruya said encouragingly. \"But be careful it doesn't tip too far back, because then you go straight into moe-mode!\""
    nvl clear
    "Kyon held the mirror up for Yuki, uncertain if she really needed it. To his surprise, the smaller girl seemed very interested in her reflection, studying it closely as she tipped the cap back. When it was so far back he thought it was about to fall off, Tsuruya was right. It made Yuki look waifish and innocent, almost lost. Not menacing in the slightest."

Much to Kyon's surprise, the large bun fit beneath the very curly and springy blonde wig. \"One last step!\" She snapped her fingers, and the door slid open, revealing the maid that Kyon was beginning to suspect was a ninja."

    "Maruyama Iyouji was happy with his role in life, generally. He had a job, regular hours, and a small bit of respect. He belonged to an organization that relied on his skills, while also protecting him from things he couldn't handle on his own."
    nvl clear
    "All told, his life had only improved from the day he first joined the Fujiya branch of the Sumiyoshi-rengo. He had been recruited very young, while he was debating attending high school in the first place. He'd heard that those who elected not to go to high school and enter straight into the working world called middle school 'Yakuza Finishing School', but hadn't realized how close to the truth the phrase was until he started looking for work."
    nvl clear
    "A middle school education hadn't left him equipped for anything better than manual labor, and even though he was quite good with numbers, he couldn't find work anywhere without a better diploma than the one he had. Fortune smiled upon him then, and he was approached by his current boss, Fujiya Masao. Masao had brought him in from the streets and gave him simple jobs to start out, and he quickly proved his worth, moving from the 'little brother' rank of shatei to the 'accountant' rank of kaikei."
    nvl clear
    "From a technical standpoint, he knew the move was a lateral transition, but he didn't mind in the least. It would be the extent of his career, but he had a job in Masao's main headquarters, and got to rub elbows with the 'big brother' ranked kyoudai. He would never be revered as an advisor, or a legal guide, and he had no chance of becoming any form of boss.... But he got to spend his days counting money and reporting where they were being shorted."
    nvl clear
    "Sure, when they first started out, money was scarce, manpower was low, and the knowledge that they were operating on the edge of Yamaguchi-gumi territory was intimidating. But Masao had persevered, and Iyouji had happily preserver-ed along with him. Slowly but surely, the Fujiya branch of the Nishinomiya area Sumiyoshi-rengo had risen in power."
    nvl clear
    "And everything had gone fairly well, despite some doubtful ventures into the area of internet-based sales. Not that he was involved with those; Masao had found another kaikei who was better equipped to deal with the technical parts. That did suit Iyouji, though. If something went wrong, and the police followed the trail from the internet to their headquarters, it wouldn't have anything to do with him."
    nvl clear
    "But no, the rising concern lately had been something that happened last Sunday. Masao's top two enforcers and ten kyoudai.... Not the entirety of their force, but almost all of their best fighters had been out, working on some plan that Iyouji didn't know the details of. They had encountered a lone girl and her bodyguard."
    nvl clear
    "In this encounter (and Iyouji liked that word, it suggested minimal violence), the girl's bodyguard had broken one of the Fujiya enforcer's arms."
    nvl clear
    "This demanded satisfaction on the part of the slighted force, naturally, and the twelve of them subdued the bodyguard (even though 'subdued' meant a trip to the hospital in this instance, Iyouji was more comfortable with that word) and had even begun articulating plans on what to do with the girl. Verbalizing them, no less, in shamed admissions to Masao when he questioned his men later. Iyouji had no practical experience with the idea, but knew the theory well enough; 'subdue' her, drug her, ship her off to someone who could find a 'use' for her, and never speak of it again."
    nvl clear
    "Unsavory, but they'd already 'subdued' the bodyguard to a pulp in retaliation, so what was the sense in backing out? The problem had been that, according to the enforcers and kyoudai later, another bodyguard of the girl had shown up. And then singlehandedly proceeded to ... well, 'subdue' wasn't quite strong enough a word here. He decided that 'sternly chastise' worked reasonably. The other bodyguard had {i}very{/i} sternly chastised a force of twelve experienced and trained fighters, even if one of the best combatants in that group {i}did{/i} have a broken arm."
    nvl clear
    "No one knew who this mysterious second bodyguard was. But they were able to piece together the identity of the first bodyguard, thanks to a few cautious questions to other locals. That was where their problems began in truth."
    "They hadn't found some nameless rich girl and her bodyguard in the wrong section of town at the worst possible time. They had unexpectedly run into a member of the Tsuruya branch of the Yamaguchi-gumi. Not entirely surprising, admittedly; despite Masao's foothold, Nishinomiya was generally their city."
    nvl clear
    "But, no, it had gotten worse! It wasn't merely a member of the Tsuruya {i}branch{/i}. It was a member of the Tsuruya {i}family{/i}. This had brought rather a lot of unwelcome attention upon their group. Moreover, in the encounter (such a safe word!), the second bodyguard had made a point of guaranteeing that the girl would never again face any of them without him at her side."
    nvl clear
    "That led to very uncomfortable silences in the headquarters. The group's confidence was crushed two-fold. Firstly, at the staggering horror of the one- sided encounter involving the second bodyguard, who by all accounts was fairly young — probably a high school student. Secondly, at the realization that the Tsuruya branch of the Yamaguchi-gumi, which had ignored them for so long, was now likely to seek revenge."
    nvl clear
    "As if that wasn't bad enough ... a few days after that horrible Sunday, one of their outlying branch offices had endured an 'encounter' as well! Masao had become furious at the revelation that Watanabe, the only completely un- {i}chastised{/i} enforcer of his rank in the field, {i}hadn't gotten the memo{/i}. He'd got the initial notice, certainly, but didn't realize that he was provoking a member of the {i}Tsuruya{/i} family. So naturally, she and her bodyguard-from-hell had {i}sternly chastised{/i} Watanabe and his men, consigned the computer and all records at the site to an eternal rest, and just to add insult to worse insult, {i}chastised{/i} a non-yakuza supplier to Watanabe's operation!"
    nvl clear
    "Despite Watanabe's belated insistence that the second bodyguard hadn't been {i}that{/i} much of a fighter (hard to believe, given that he still {i}chastised{/i} Watanabe and a trio of kyoudai), worse damage had been done. Watanabe had blathered on about {i}revenge{/i} against the Tsuruya family! And all they had for their trouble was a nickname for the bodyguard, and the fact that he wore a Kitago uniform?"
    nvl clear
    "Still, their woes weren't eternal. Only yesterday, they had been approached by a civilian seeking to supply them with more of the materials that had been lost at Watanabe's office."
    nvl clear
    "Iyouji nodded to himself and rose from his spreadsheets, stretching his arms over his head and knuckling back a yawn. His desk was in one corner of a warehouse-like room, the rest of the space taken up with boxes of various goods, chairs, tables, personal effects, and at the moment, twenty three of the group's best fighters, split up into groups playing cards, mahjong, and dice. Masao's office was in the back, and the boss in question stepped into the room just as the accountant looked over."

    "That scene would be etched into Iyouji's mind forever. Just as he was trying to think of something witty to say, some clever joke to help relieve some of the stress floating around the room, the door to the pachinko parlor that served as a front opened. The 'little brother' on duty as an attendant stepped into the room, glancing around briefly, then moving to Iyouji's side."
    nvl clear
    "\"What is it?\" Iyouji asked the man as he approached."
    "\"Um, someone's here to see you,\" he said, frowning. \"Well, I think it goes to you. A high school student? Says he wants to sell you some pictures? Has two of his classmates with him ... I guess they're a gang? From Hikami Gakuen.\""

A boy with his hair spiked back, a ditsy bubble-gum chewing kogal behind him, and one of those small, sullen, quiet types who was probably good with unpleasant weapons, wearing a boy's uniform hat. Iyouji was immediately stricken with a strange sense of familiarity with the smaller girl. A picture he had seen recently, somewhere? Maybe he had passed her in the street?"
    nvl clear
    "Her eyes didn't go to him for a moment, instead moving to Masao and locking there."
    "\"So,\" Masao said, crossing his arms over the chest of his suit and sizing up the trio. \"You want to sell something?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Pictures,\" the boy said after a moment, scanning the room thoughtfully, his previous grin fading to a sour expression. \"You buy them, right? I heard that there was some guy ... what was his name ... Watanabe? But he doesn't seem to be in business anymore.\""
    nvl clear
    "Watanabe was recovering in a hospital, and only two of his immediate subordinates was still in good condition, escaping with just stun gun charges. \"That's right,\" Masao said, shaking his head. \"Listen, I'd like to explain something here, before you get the wrong impression of us. We are {i}businessmen{/i}, after all. Mere thuggery and petty crimes are not our primary goal, but you know how it goes; it pays the bills, right?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Like, totally,\" the kogal agreed, snapping her bubblegum loudly."
    "\"Anyway, what's your name?\" Masao asked, squinting as he studied the boy's frame."
    "\"Shirahama Kenichi,\" he answered without hesitation."
    nvl clear
    "\"Right. Well, Shirahama-kun,\" Masao said, grinning, \"I'm Fujiya Masao. Even though you are in the presence of the oyabun of the Fujiya branch of the Sumiyoshi-rengo, relax a bit. I'll even let you call me 'aniki'.\" Iyouji blinked at that. This newcomer was already being allowed to call the head of the branch 'big brother'?"
    nvl clear
    "\"Very kind of you,\" Shirahama said, raising one eyebrow. \"But, I thought you were interested in buying...?\""
    "\"Of course,\" Masao agreed, nodding. \"But you look a capable sort. Ambitious, too. It takes a strong man to keep two women, doesn't it?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"My guy is totally cool enough to handle, like, way more than that, you know,\" the kogal said with a huge grin. After a moment, the silent girl nodded her agreement."
    "\"Lucky,\" a few of the other men in the room grumbled, setting down their dice and cards to watch the exchange."
    nvl clear
    "\"Right,\" Masao continued, nodding. \"So, this is small change in the grand scheme of things. Think of the opportunities you have! You could go much further with your abilities — I can tell that much at a glance!\" Iyouji hid a grimace. Masao was trying to recruit the newcomer. Was their branch hurting {i}that{/i} badly for insulting the Tsuruya family? Or was Masao thinking of stringing the boy along like a patsy, throwing him to the wolves, so to speak, when the Tsuruya family actually came seeking revenge?"
    nvl clear
    "\"You're trying to get me to join your boryokudan?\" he asked, skeptical."
    "The other men in the room bristled at the term, and Iyouji felt himself grimacing as well. He wasn't a violent person, and didn't care for the label at {i}all{/i}. 'Violence group'?"
    nvl clear
    "\"Don't talk like that,\" Masao growled, his friendly demeanour vanishing for a moment before he recovered it, though his cheer was much diminished. \"Ah, you watch too many crime dramas. We're ninkyo dantai. The Sumiyoshi-rengo is a democratic association of independent groups that all band together for survival. In this climate, with police, the NPA, and dangerous other groups like the Yamaguchi-gumi on the loose, we have to band together. Really, we're the underdogs, clinging to survival where we can.\""
    nvl clear
    "The boy said nothing for a moment, while the kogal snapped her bubblegum again. \"Okay, yeah, that's ... really great,\" Shirahama said, shaking his head. \"No offense, but we're really just here about the pictures.\""
    "Masao scowled. \"You're missing out on a great opportunity,\" he warned. \"But, fine. What do you have?\""
    nvl clear
    "Shirahama pulled an envelope from his pocket. \"SD cards,\" he answered. \"Various students changing into uniforms. I heard from ... a friend that this was going on in other schools in town, right?\""
    "\"It has been,\" Iyouji agreed, holding a hand out for the envelope."
    nvl clear
    "Shirahama didn't hand over the envelope, just waving it back and forth. \"Yeah? There's this girl I'm trying to dig up some dirt on ... maybe instead of a sale, we could arrange a trade?\""
    "\"{i}Now{/i} you're speaking my language,\" Masao agreed, grinning. \"What school?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"You have pictures from more than one?\" Shirahama asked, raising an eyebrow."
    "\"A few,\" Iyouji said, his eyes drifting to the envelope again. \"But you didn't answer the question.\""

    "\"Kitago,\" Shirahama said, nodding. \"She'd be a third year. Kind of tall, really long green hair.\" The kogal grinned, chewing away on her bubblegum. The shorter girl's eyes slowly drifted from Masao to Iyouji. The accountant felt his blood drop in temperature several degrees from the coolness of her gaze."
    nvl clear
    "\"We might have something like that,\" Iyouji said hesitantly. \"Why the interest in this girl?\""
    "\"She's like, totally the heir to the Tsuruya family,\" the kogal explained. \"She'd be like, super {i}mega{/i} pissed off if she found pictures of herself on the internet one day, you know?\""

    "Masao worked his jaw for a moment, eyebrows drawing together before he turned and glared at Iyouji. \"I don't do the computer stuff!\" he said defensively to his boss. \"You know that! I just do numbers!\" Suddenly, Iyouji began to understand how the strange 'encounter' of the previous Sunday had come about.

    "He never got close; the slight girl moved suddenly, standing in front of the large man and gently rebuffing him with a palm-strike to the solar plexus. The eighty kilo man was launched through the air in a high arc, landing with a resounding crash on one of the crates lining the room. The other man was knocked down with a foot-sweep from the boy, sending him hurtling to the floor to immediately be subdued with another charge from the Tsuruya heir's stun gun. The green-haired girl began to laugh from deep in her throat."

    "The small girl was an unstoppable, untouchable storm. Two large brutes leapt to tackle her; she dashed towards them, flipping in midair and axe-kicking each in the back of the head simultaneously, using the recoil from her powerfully admonishing blows to launch herself knee-first at a third man, just readying a length of chain as a weapon. Her knee chastised him in the face with a muffled crunch and a surreal explosion of red; she flipped yet again, landing behind her latest foe as all three crashed to the floor. The heiress's laugh began to grow, booming and genuinely mirthful."

    "Five men reached the boy at the same time as he leapt back, the heiress behind him moving towards the doorway. The five of Masao's men tangled, two of them falling down and scrambling away, one of the remaining three being rebuffed with a baton cracked onto his shoulder — hard. That man slammed to the floor, subdued, just as the heiress jabbed the enforcer in the front who had come to investigate, sending pulsing streaks of crackling electricity across his body."
    "Seventeen."

    "The smaller girl flowed around and through attacks, dodging larger well- trained combatants with casual, indifferent ease. The largest of her assailants received a double-palm strike to the abdomen. Despite the fact that he had to out-mass her by more than four times her weight, at a minimum, he was hurled lengthwise across the room, smashing through a table and continuing on to collide with another man. The top of the large man's skull impacted with another crunch into the face of the man he had struck, and both tumbled on in surreally slow motion to Iyouji's eyes, a shower of stray teeth and bright red flying outward."

    "After retreating nearly to the point where he collided with the heiress he was supposed to be protecting, the bodyguard suddenly sprang forward, bringing his left baton down on one man's wrist, another of those resoundingly crunching chastisements filling the room with an unholy shriek of pain as his right baton deflected a knife. He spun with the recoil of the deflection, faster than Iyouji thought was reasonable, but slower than the small girl. As he turned, he raised one foot and then brought it down on another man, subduing him with a brutal axe-kick."
    "Thirteen."

Eyes turning to a man who glared at her from the other side of one of the tables, she kicked the tabletop suddenly, flipping it into a vertical surface, then leaping atop it. Before he could move, the surface smashed down on him, and she rode it with perfect balance, rebounding when the tangled mess beneath her reached the floor to tag another man with a flying kick."

The man screamed in agony and clutched his injured hand in his good one, but the boy hadn't finished. He seized the man's head in both hands and threw him down towards the floor, simultaneously raising one knee and slamming the man's face into it. There was a spray of crimson and another of those sickening crunches as the man fell to the floor, sternly chastised."

The boy gathered his batons and collapsed them, stowing them in the sleeves of his uniform shirt, watching warily. \"Alright,\" Masao said, his face reddening. \"You've beaten the life out of all my men, you've ruined my operation in this town — and {i}why{/i}?\""

To make up for the facts that some {i}stupid{/i} delinquent at my own school got {i}lucky{/i} and then sold pictures to {i}you{/i}!

We can stop it here at the Fujiya-branch. We can let this end before {i}you{/i} end up cutting off a finger for yubitsume to your own boss, or worse, insist on being killed, just to put your own men in line for that fate next!\""
    nvl clear
    "For a moment, Iyouji was afraid that Masao would refuse. But then one of the men on the floor moaned weakly, rolling onto his back and cradling a wounded arm. It seemed that, for the moment, concern for his own men beat out the need for pride. \"Very well,\" Masao said, his voice thick with disgust. \"I'm calling a medic for my men. Iyouji ... you make sure that the Haru-tachi leaves happy.\" He turned and strode away, the swords still lying on the table."

    "The boy looked uncomfortable, but nodded. Iyouji didn't understand how someone so powerful could be so unaware of the damage he did, but then, that wasn't his role in the organization. Bowing very low to the green-haired girl, he said, \"I am Maruyama Iyouji; I am ranked kaikei. I will do everything in my power to satisfy your demands, Tsuruya-sama.\""

    nvl clear
    "\"I still feel like a wuss,\" he mumbled, once they reached the car. Tsuruya still leaned against him once they were seated, one arm around his shoulders.

    nvl clear
    "\"That's it,\" Tsuruya agreed, nodding. \"But ... Kyon-kun, more than anything else we are, ninkyo dantai ranking, students who talk to eachothers at school, any of that....

    "\"No,\" she said with reassuring confidence. \"You gave them a stern talkings to. You maybe dislocated things, but you didn't break many bones, or do worse. Even though you were very mad.... Hey, is it okay for me to tell you that?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Maybe not,\" he admitted, forcing a weak smile. \"So, thanks, and I'll leave it at that. Despite everything, until very recently, I'd never actually used violence against another person. But now ... ever since I.... Since.... Last Sunday, I guess, I've been getting myself into these dangerous situations.\""
    nvl clear
    "Tsuruya shifted at his side, her head turning away as she gazed out the window thoughtfully. \"Really,\" she said softly, \"it's {i}my{/i} faults. I got you involved, and—\""
    nvl clear
    "\"No, no, don't even try that,\" he protested. \"We can't.... We just had a major victory, didn't we? And what am I doing? I'm getting us all depressed and—\" He took a deep breath and shrugged his shoulders free of Tsuruya, then raised his arms and put one about the taller girl, pulling her close to him. \"I do not regret helping you, Tsuruya-kun. I'm just ... a little afraid of what I can do now, you know?\""
    nvl clear
    "And even though she had said nothing, merely watching as always, he put another arm about Yuki, pulling her close on the other side. \"And Nagato, I don't regret learning what you taught me for a minute, either. It's thanks to that teaching that I was able to save Kanae-chan from Ryuguu, and help Tsuruya-kun with her distinction. Hell, the entire school owes you and Tsuruya-kun a big thanks for this!\""
    nvl clear
    "Something sparked deep in Yuki's eyes at that. She said nothing, but her eternally cool gaze warmed for him, and she allowed herself to be pulled close. When he relaxed his impromptu hug, neither girl moved away from him. He had come to realize that Tsuruya was simply very affectionate, probably a side-effect of her typically energetic outlook. But when he studied Yuki, she merely turned her eyes away and bowed her head slightly, pressing it into the side of his chest."
    nvl clear
    "Did that mean something? He was probably better off not thinking about it, all told."
    "\"Okies,\" Tsuruya said, as the car rolled through the gates to her estate. \"Our clothes should be clean soon, so let's all take a bath together!\""
    nvl clear

    "Well, he decided, if even Yuki thought it was for the best, who was he to complain?"

    "After a bath with Yuki and Tsuruya — more work than he had expected, given the need to scrub Tsuruya clean of the tanning solution — the taller girl had explained she was going to meet with her father. Kyon thought the man lived on the estate, but evidently he spent most of his time in an apartment in the city."
    nvl clear
    "He had stored images in his not-quite-photographic memory of Yuki's pale skin and soft touch when her fingers had gone through his hair, adeptly scrubbing the gel out and restoring him to normality. Tsuruya's image and the feel of her washing his back wasn't likely to fade any time soon, either. Memories stored safely between a record of walking in on Mikuru while changing, and a pair of kisses with Haruhi in closed space, he felt a certain peace of mind."

    "\"For today,\" he answered, as his mother stomped down the hallway towards him, murder in her gaze. A small part of his mind noted her stance and visage, recording the details for use the next time he needed to menace someone for Tsuruya."

    "\"Kyon!\" the woman snarled, fists trembling at her sides. \"{i}What{/i} do you have to say for yourself!? I hope you're prepared for cram-school!\""
    "\"I got a ninety two,\" he answered, handing his test over to her as he walked past. \"Thanks to Haruhi helping me study.\""

    "\"Don't think this is over yet!\" his mother yelled, glaring at the test as though expecting to see some sign of forgery. \"I told you to stop acting like a delinquent! And what do you do? You {i}dangle a student out of the window{/i}! What could {i}possibly{/i} justify that!?\""

    "Kyon paused, one foot on the stairs, and mulled it over. \"I broke up an illegal voyeur photography ring taking advantage of the school,\" he said, after consideration. \"Then, after that, me and two of my delinquent friends cosplayed as students of a different school and went into a pachinko parlor. Once we got inside, we convinced a low-ranking member of the Sumiyoshi-rengo to let us into the back room, and hospitalized nearly thirty members of their boryokudan. After that, we took a bath together to wash the blood off.\""

    "\"Kyon's saving the world,\" his little sister supplied helpfully, giving a judicious nod. \"Just like a sentai hero! He's doing it for Tsuru-nee-san and Haru-nee-san!\""

    "\"I don't know who this 'Tsuru' character is,\" Kyon's mother growled, \"but I am getting very tired of your behavior! Until further notice, you are {i}grounded{/i}. No more club meetings for you! And you are taking your sister to Hinamizawa for Golden Week — you're going to be on the train to visit my brother Friday after school next week!\""

    "Kyon felt his left eyebrow twitch. Okay, he told himself. Maybe he shouldn't have mouthed off to his mother. \"Well,\" he said, shrugging, \"that's about what I expected.\""
    "\"We're going to Hinamizawa?\" his little sister asked excitedly. \"I didn't want to go unless Kyon-kun was going! But now that Kyon-kun is going, I want to go for sure!\""

    "\"Cram-school!\" his mother yelled up the stairs after him when he plodded towards his room. \"And you can expect to have a talk with your father tonight!\""

    "After dropping Kyon off, the limo turned around, headed towards Yuki's apartment. It would have been faster to drop Yuki off first, but Tsuruya wanted a chance to talk with the other girl, anyway."
    "\"Hey, Nagato-chi,\" she said, once Kyon was out of sight. \"Do you mind if we talk about Kyon-kun a bit?\""
    "\"That is fine,\" Yuki replied, her eyes fixed on something outside of the window."
    nvl clear
    "\"Mmm. You know, I think that Haru-nyan and Kyon-kun like each other.\""
    "\"Likely,\" Yuki agreed."
    "\"But ... you know ... these days, I think I like Kyon-kun a lot, too.\" Tsuruya sighed, leaning her head against the glass of the window. \"I feel a bit bad, because I know that Haru-nyan likes Kyon-kun, even if she's bad about saying it. But, do you think that Haru-nyan would share?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I have ... permission to borrow him,\" Yuki said slowly, as though uncertain. \"But I require external confirmation that he has interest in me.\""
    "She smirked at the smaller girl. \"Silly,\" she chastised Yuki. \"He was trying not to be obvious, but Kyon-kun is a boy, you know. Wasn't he peeking at you in the bath?\" Not, Tsuruya admitted to herself with a small amount of pride, that he didn't peek at her a bit, too. And she had managed to get a rewarding eyeful of her own, anyway."

    "Yuki's head tilted slightly in consideration."
    "\"Mmm. Things may be confusing for Kyon-kun, and I hope it's not troublesome ... but he's got a big heart. I can tell he likes you a lot! I hope maybe he likes me a lot, too. I think he likes me a little, at least! Well! I think I'll try for Kyon-kun, just a little bit ... but I guess I can't be mischievous enough to upset Haru-nyan. I think you should, too! Even Mikuru- chan says she's trying!\""
    "\"I see,\" Yuki replied, quietly thoughtful."
