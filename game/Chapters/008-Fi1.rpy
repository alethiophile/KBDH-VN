    "He woke again, head reeling with the 'extended' session. He didn't want to think how much longer in 'relative time' he'd spent in training with Nagato. If the average session was a 'short' single year...."
    "Blinking, he realized he was staring at the ceiling of another unfamiliar room ... though details began to trickle back into place. Last night, he'd taken a bath with Tsuruya, though the blood loss from his injury kept him from reacting embarrassingly ... except to get very light-headed. He'd tried his best not to stare at the girl, but she was totally unabashed, completely uncaring. True to her words, she had scrubbed his back in return without hesitation, and then carefully washed his hair so he wouldn't get any shampoo or soap in his wound."
    nvl clear
    "After that, she'd led him to her room, where two futons had been set up side-by-side. He was wearing a light robe, one that matched Tsuruya's ... and evidently in the middle of the night at some point, she'd rolled over onto his futon and wrapped her arms around him. She slept with her hair done up in a pair of buns on either side of her head, probably so she wouldn't pull her hair when she shifted about."

    "As he stared at her in bewilderment, his eyes tracking down to where her robe was left open by her slumbering movements— He quickly looked away, fighting down a surge of panic. Okay, light-headed from blood loss and following his future self's orders was one thing ... but this ... {i}this{/i} was the kind of thing that would cause Haruhi to level most of the city, and that was probably before closed space or her powers came into the picture."

    "\"Er.... Um, good morning, Tsuruya-kun,\" he managed as she sat up, releasing him. What should he say in this situation!? 'Thank you for last night?' Maybe something flattering? The words that actually spilled from his mouth were, \"Did you rest well?\""

    "\"Pretty good!\" she said, pulling her robe closed the rest of the way and climbing to her feet to stretch again. \"Though, I had a funny thought that Kyon-kun suddenly vanished last night.\" She frowned, touching one fingertip to her lower lip and pondering. \"Maybe a dream— Ah! Kyon-kun! Your bandage is gone!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Er, I'm a quick healer,\" he assured her, touching a fingertip to where the stitches had been and climbing to his own feet."
    "\"Ooh!\" she enthused, grinning brightly and leaning close to stare at the spot where his injury was. \"Mega-awesome healing factor,\" she cheered. \"I'm glad! I'd feel all kinds of bad if you got really hurt taking care of mes!\""

    nvl clear
    "She nodded at someone he couldn't see through the doorway and took a bundle of cloth into her arms, sliding the door shut with one foot then spinning around and presenting it to him. He accepted it, realizing it was his school uniform. Humming to herself, Tsuruya went to one of the seemingly identical panels around the room and slid it to one side, revealing a dresser. She nonchalantly collected her underclothes and school uniform for the day and dropped her robe to the floor."
    nvl clear
    "He quickly spun away, too self-conscious to do the same, pulling his boxer shorts on before dropping the robe to the floor and dressing. To his surprise, even his tie had been washed. He spent a long moment consulting the emergency reference card he left in his wallet to correctly re-knot the tie, and turned around just as Tsuruya was letting her hair down. She glanced back at him, smiling as he finished adjusting his tie."
