    "He followed the girl into the sprawling mansion, as she led him down a maze of twisting hallways before finally entering a large meeting hall."
    "Most of the Tsuruya estate was a single floor, baring any scary basements Kyon was happy not to know about, but he saw that this room had a raised ceiling, which suggested that one of the few parts of the house that seemed to be higher was merely to provide a wider open area like they one they entered."
    nvl clear
    "The room was ten meters wide at least, and probably twice that in length. Banners and well preserved Tsuruya family heirlooms adorned the walls, ranging from a picture of an ancestor seemingly from just before World War Two, to a cracked and re-lacquered woodcut that looked like it was straight out of the fifteenth century — and probably was."
    "Ancient weapons hung here and there, presumably keepsakes of prominent familial figures. The far end of the room was a raised platform, reminding Kyon of a dais."
    nvl clear
    "The far wall of the room was covered with a floor-length and wall-wide sheet of cloth bearing the symbol he guessed was the Tsuruya family kumon, the ancient crest from their family's founding. The stylized classic shapes of five cranes in a wheel formation beneath the peaked roof of a great house."
    nvl clear
    "Below that, on a large cushion was a man that seemed small only compared to the massive regalia behind him. If the large figure of the Tsuruya family patriarch wasn't imposing enough, the identically dressed and immaculate men in blue suits lining the sides of the room in orderly rows were enough to make him even more nervous."
    nvl clear
    "He counted twenty other men in the room in two rows of ten, facing the entryway as he tried to keep from stumbling, following in Tsuruya's composed, poised wake."

    "The Tsuruya family patriarch was as tall as Kyon while sitting cross-legged on a thin cushion atop the dais, sporting neatly groomed short green hair — identical in shade to the girl's, while his amused, knowing smirk betrayed an identical fang as well."
    "Despite the fact that every other man was wearing a suit in the room, the patriarch managed to make all of the others look under-dressed, wearing only a green robe, less formal than the girl's, with the family crest patterned all across it."
    nvl clear
    "Moreover, he had one arm free of the robe, baring half his chest and revealing the complex and detailed tattoos adorning him. Kyon tried not to gawk; it must have taken real courage and quite some time to have the vivid image of a fierce crane fishing a dragon from the heavens tattooed. It looked so lifelike, he practically expected it to leap off the man with one flexed muscle."

    "Nervously searching for something familiar to comfort him in this madness, Kyon spotted a maid in the customary outfit kneeling just below the dais on the man's right side, holding a tray before her, eyes downcast. Was she the same one that had spoken to him and asked that he watch over Tsuruya? The same one — somehow — that had met them on the path through the gardens? There was still no way to be sure."
