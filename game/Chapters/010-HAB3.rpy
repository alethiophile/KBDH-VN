    nvl clear
    "\"It may be possible to arrange that,\" Koizumi allowed, glancing back at Kyon and giving a small nod. \"However ... you are correct in that it would be in your better interests to leave. My suggestion, then, would be to have a good reason to go home. Do not attempt to contact Yamane, or your subordinates. Just ... go home, make sure your story is in order when official questioning comes along — and it will — and if you want to save face, see about withdrawing before you are expelled.\""

Kanae was curious as to the nature of the project ... and as soon as she finished her manga, she planned on asking the upperclassman what she was up to. The door opened and Kanae looked up as Haruhi marched to the laptop Yuki had left turned on, Yuki, Tsuruya, and an unfamiliar girl with a glowing red face just behind her."
    nvl clear
    "\"Hello!\" she greeted the quartet cheerfully."
    "\"Ah,\" Mikuru managed, rising to pour tea for everyone. \"Who's our guest?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Yanagimoto Ai,\" the girl introduced herself with a grumble. \"Temporary ally.\""
    "Haruhi introduced Mikuru and Kanae in turn, naming them, \"Chief Mascot\" and \"Mascot Trainee\"."
    nvl clear
    "Kanae wondered if that meant she would get fun costumes like Mikuru. Hopefully another maid outfit, since her sempai really seemed to like those!"
    "\"Okay,\" Haruhi said, \"now to wait for Kyon to tell us what he got!\" Before anyone could ask clarification, Haruhi's phone began to chime. \"Ah! It's Kyon!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"What was that song?\" Mikuru asked. \"Is that a new ring-tone?\""
    "\"It's from an older DDR soundtrack,\" Yanagimoto noted, her expression still dark. \"It's called 'God of Romance'.\""
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi's face reddened and she shot a death-glare at Yanagimoto. The other girl ignored it, sipping at her tea."
    "\"Kyon,\" Haruhi snapped into her phone, \"what's going on?\""
    nvl clear
    "She listened to his explanation, her eyebrows rising. \"Okay,\" she allowed. \"Bring it here, then we'll take down the final boss! It's obvious, really!\""
    "\"What's going on?\" Kanae asked, setting her manga down."
    nvl clear
    "Tsuruya raised an eyebrow of her own. \"If it's a final boss, I gotta be there too,\" she said resolutely."
    "\"I don't particularly want to miss it myself,\" Haruhi grumbled. \"Ah, but, Kanae-chan, Kyon and Koizumi are finally starting to wrap things up. Yanagimoto is going to help expose the big boss and we'll resolve everything.\""
    nvl clear
    "That wasn't really much of an answer, so Kanae just gave a knowing nod and turned her attention to Yanagimoto. \"You play DDR?\" she asked."
    "\"Not really,\" the second year girl answered, seeming to only just notice Kanae for the first time. \"It's a pretty fast song, but one of the gymnasts I admired had a routine set to it not long ago.\""
    nvl clear
    "Just as well, Kanae decided, DDR was fun, but every world had a wildly varying selection of tracks, so she never got very good at it. \"So, you're a gymnast, then?\" she asked."
    "\"Yeah ... you should ask your president about it. She joined our club for one day before she ditched us.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"It was boring,\" Haruhi noted unapologetically."
    "\"And this club is more interesting?\" Yanagimoto asked skeptically."
    "\"You bet,\" Haruhi replied, throwing back her entire cup of tea in a single gulp. \"Stick around a while, you'll see.\""
    nvl clear
    "Kanae's sempai knocked at the door, and Mikuru folded her paper in half, hiding the markings. \"Come in!\" she called."
    "Koizumi opened the door and entered, followed by the sempai. \"Ah? What happened to delinquent-mode?\" Tsuruya asked, hopping to her feet and moving to Kanae's sempai's side."
    nvl clear
    "\"Ran into a teacher and needed to look normal,\" he answered."
    "Tsuruya nodded sagely and plucked the pin from the boy's tie, moving it to his lapel. \"There,\" she said decisively."
    nvl clear
    "Koizumi glanced at the other boy, pulling an envelope from his pocket. \"Daimonji has been taken care of,\" he said. \"Well, mostly. Mori-san will take care of things from the administrative end, and the Organization will be ready to take care of everything else we need done once we've finished this and can deliver a full report to them on ... what's going on.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Good,\" Haruhi said, nodding. \"Excellent work.\" Her gaze went to Kanae's sempai, and one eyebrow rose. Mikuru was running a length of string across him, measuring him and jotting notes down on a pad of paper. \"So, was there any violence?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Weirdly enough, we lucked out and Daimonji folded like a cheap suit,\" he answered, shrugging. \"We just came in and— WAAH!\" He stared wide-eyed, at Mikuru, who was merely humming to herself as she pulled her hands back from his leg and jotted another note down on her pad of paper."
    nvl clear
    "\"That...\" Haruhi started, before she fell short, narrowing her eyes and staring at Mikuru intently. \"That was pretty bold, Mikuru.... I'm not sure how I feel about being that forward, but I think it'd better not happen again any time soon!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Did.... Did Asahina-san just molest Sempai?\" Kanae wondered, not sure if she had seen it right, or it was her imagination."
    "\"What?\" Mikuru asked, blinking as she looked around at everyone else in the club, all with eyes fixed on her. \"What happened?\""
    nvl clear
    "Yuki blinked several times, then explained, \"Asahina Mikuru was merely measuring the length of his inseam.\""
    "\"Exactly,\" Mikuru agreed with a nod, looking confused. \"Did it seem like something else happened?\""
    nvl clear
    "He coughed, his face red. \"Um, anyway,\" he managed, \"we thought we'd give that to you and see where we should go from there.\""
    "Haruhi opened the envelope, pulling out a sheet of folded paper and a small stack of SD cards. \"What's this, a list of names?\" she asked, frowning."
    nvl clear
    "\"The third year collectors,\" Koizumi offered."
    "\"Tsuruya-kun has the first year collectors,\" Kanae's sempai added. \"All that's left is Yamane and the second year collector names.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"And he's going down,\" Yanagimoto added. \"I don't follow whatever madness is happening in this room, but I know that one fact! That's the only reason I'm here.\""
    "\"Right, well, then let's go get him and finish this off!\" Haruhi declared, grinning."
    nvl clear
    "\"Ah....\" Koizumi looked uncomfortable, his smile weakening. \"Is that wise?\""
    "\"I think you should leave this to me and Tsuruya-kun,\" Kanae's sempai said, shaking his head. \"Haruhi, you and Koizumi need to be ready to deal with the student council president.\""
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi glowered at him, then nodded reluctantly. \"Alright,\" she sighed. \"I get the stupid desk job. Go be an action hero.\""
    "\"Yeah, because that's exactly what my academic career needs,\" he replied, nodding. \"And my mother — can't forget her.\""
    "\"You're the one who told me to stay here and prepare to bail you out,\" she warned him."
    nvl clear
    "\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" Yanagimoto interrupted. \"However, I do know that Yamane will let me into his club room, and lunch is going to end pretty soon — if you're going to do anything, we'd probably better hurry.\""
    nvl clear
    "Tsuruya leaned close to the boy and eyed him critically before producing a hairbrush and straightening out his hair. \"You know Yamane better than I do,\" she said, while he obediently held still and neatened his appearance up. \"So you want to talks to him?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I imagine I'm not the only one who wants to get a word in,\" he allowed, glancing at Yanagimoto. \"But, yeah, let's get this over with.\""
    "\"Fine,\" Yanagimoto muttered, moving towards the door."
    nvl clear
    "\"Wait!\" Haruhi barked, standing up and slapping her palms on the desk in front of her. \"Yanagimoto ... I still don't know what your problem with us is ... but we're going to talk about it later.\""
    nvl clear
    "Yanagimoto lowered her face, then grudgingly nodded. \"We'll see about that {i}after{/i} Yamane,\" she allowed."
    "Yuki closed her book and rose, setting it on the seat she had just vacated. \"I will go also,\" she announced quietly."
    nvl clear
    "With that, the four left the classroom. Koizumi sighed, taking his usual seat and eyeing the empty cup that Yanagimoto had left behind. Mikuru turned her attention to her paper, unfolding it again and measuring against the numbers she had collected from Kanae's sempai. \"A coat doesn't have an inseam, Mikuru- chan,\" Haruhi mused."
    nvl clear
    "\"I might make other things,\" Mikuru answered absently, absorbed in her current project."
    "\"Hmm.... I think you should measure Kanae-chan next.\" Haruhi gave a decisive nod. \"She's your trainee, you know!\""
    "\"Oh! Do I get a maid costume?\" Kanae asked excitedly. This part of the conversation she could follow."
    nvl clear
    "Koizumi quirked an eyebrow, and rose to pour himself a cup of tea."
    "\"We've already done that,\" Haruhi dismissed. \"Plus, I think Kyon's developing a maid fetish, and he shouldn't look at you that way.\""
    "Kanae pouted. \"I wanted a maid costume....\""
    nvl clear
    "\"What about a stewardess? Yeah, with your kawaiiko features and small frame, I think you would look even more moe in uniforms.\""
    "\"Ooh, that might be fun! But I'm not a kawaiiko, I use 'I'.\" She pondered. \"Would Sempai like Kanae-chan more if she refered to herself in the third person?\""
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi made a choking noise, then crossed her arms in an 'x'. \"Negative!\" she said, shaking her head quickly. \"Too burikko ... and if you become a natural, it'll be a kawaiiko overload. Anyway, Mikuru-chan, did you hear me? A stewardess outfit for Kanae-chan!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I'll get on that next,\" Mikuru murmured, rolling up the papers she had finished marking, then unfurling a bolt of cloth and producing a pair of scissors."
    "\"I swear,\" Haruhi grumbled, \"when she's really invested in a project, she's in a whole different world!\""
    "\"Well, Suzumiya-san, should we prepare our arguments for the student council?\" Koizumi suggested."
