    "Something was up. Something suspicious. Something worth investigating."
    nvl clear
    "And as soon as Haruhi finished saving Kyon's career and home life, she was going to get to the bottom of it. But after a few innocent questions turned into intense grilling, the president of the computer research society adamantly insisted he not only had never dated Kimidori Emiri, he didn't recognize the name. He admitted, once she found a picture of the girl, that she looked vaguely familiar, and then in a very defeated tone insisted that he'd never had any girlfriend at all."
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi found that strangely easy to believe. As interesting as this new quirk was, she knew it probably had nothing to do with the situation at hand, so she shelved it for later consideration. Kyon might know more, but if she didn't finish rescuing him, she'd have to brave the storm of his mother's crushing gaze to find out. And that was one prospect she did {i}not{/i} enjoy."
    nvl clear
    "\"Anyway,\" she said, tapping the top of the laptop while the president of the computer club looked irritated and quickly punched keys. \"Nevermind that for now. How much longer until you're done?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"It's finished,\" he said, hitting the last few keys, then turning it around. \"You'll have to add the pictures yourself, since you don't want me to see them—\" At her sharp look, he quickly added, \"Not that I should see them, or anything! So, uh, it's all up to you, then.\""
    nvl clear
    "She nodded, paging through the presentation, which the president of the computer club had set up. He had labeled all of the pages she could add images to with instructions for how to replace them, which would simplify the process."
    nvl clear
    "He rose, shrugging. \"At any rate, that's my contribution. I don't know what else I could bring to your arguments. Still, give my regards to Kyon, and Nagato-san.\" He paused, frowning slightly as he looked at the ceiling, then nodded."
    "\"Is that all?\" Haruhi asked, already flipping through the images taken from the SD cards, glancing at him out of the corner of her eyes."
    nvl clear
    "\"Hmm? Well....\" The man seemed torn, then shook his head and gave a sad smile. \"Ah, she's out of my reach. Tell them I wish them both the best, and good luck. I hope things work out for them.\""
    "She looked up from her work long enough to stare at him questioningly, but he seemed stuck with a melancholy expression."
    nvl clear
    "\"I'll be off,\" he said, shaking his head again. \"Take care, Suzumiya-san.\""
    "\"Yeah,\" she managed, frowning as he opened the door and stepped into the hall, just as Koizumi returned, looking a bit more worn than usual, but his eternal smile intact."
    nvl clear
    "\"Hello,\" Koizumi said cheerfully."
    "\"Back already?\" Haruhi asked, surprised. \"What about Kyon? How's the damage control?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I've done what I could,\" he said, apologetically. \"Kyon, Tsuruya-san, and Nagato have left school for the moment, and aren't likely to return today. Yamane-san is being taken to a hospital, but the police are watching him. It doesn't seem he's suffering internal bleeding or any broken bones, but he's quite badly bruised. He was too disoriented to give any testimony.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Good,\" she decided, grinning. \"Is the student council in session?\""
    "\"Yes,\" he said, his smile fading. \"But, without Kyon-kun—\""
    nvl clear
    "\"No, that's perfect,\" she insisted. \"Harder for them to pass judgment on him, Yuki-chan, or Tsuruya-san. Let's go get them before they just make up their minds because he's not been represented.\""
    "\"...of course,\" he allowed, nodding."
    nvl clear
    "She finished moving the last few pictures onto the presentation and then saved it and snapped the laptop shut. \"Let's go!\" she declared, leading the march to the student council room. They reached the door shortly, and Haruhi opened it with her usual care, kicking it violently open to slam against the wall."
    nvl clear
    "Within the room were a somewhat confused looking Okabe, a teacher that Haruhi didn't recognize, the student council president, and in one corner, noticed only because Haruhi thought to look specifically for her, Kimidori Emiri. \"Hello,\" Koizumi said uneasily."
    nvl clear
    "The student council president pursed his lips thoughtfully, not adopting his usual scorn-filled sneer, instead turning his gaze to the teachers. \"You, too, huh?\" Okabe said, breaking the silence and giving Haruhi a calculating gaze. \"Shouldn't the pair of you be in class?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Ah, I asked Koizumi-kun to come here,\" the unfamiliar teacher said, prompting Okabe to look at him in surprise. \"Koizumi-kun, if you don't mind...?\" the teacher prompted somewhat nervously."
    nvl clear
    "\"Right,\" the esper said quickly, when Haruhi turned an inquisitive gaze at him. \"As instructed, I have brought an account which should explain Kyon-kun, Tsuruya-san, and Nagato's involvement in the ... incident at lunch today.\" Haruhi began to scowl, but he quickly bowed and indicated her. \"As his club president, Suzumiya-san will present it.\""
    nvl clear
    "That was more like it, she decided. \"As I'm sure you've all heard by now,\" she said, setting the laptop on the president's desk, as the teachers reluctantly retreated towards the edges of the room to give her space, \"Kyon and the others were investigating a series of criminal actions.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Yes,\" the president said dryly, adopting his more familiar sour expression. \"Obviously, this should have been handled by your misfit 'club', and not trained professionals.\""
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi ignored the comment, turning the laptop to face him and showing the first screen. \"The issue was first discovered by Tsuruya-san,\" she explained, \"who asked Kyon for help because of the enormity of the situation.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"You have not addressed the point that this is an activity best left for professionals,\" the president remarked. \"Let us set aside your 'ends justify the means' stance for the moment, and examine that issue, first.\""
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi grimaced. She didn't like the idea of saying that the ends always justified the means, but it seemed in her experience it {i}frequently{/i} did ... a certain incident involving tackling Kyon with Mikuru's aid notwithstanding. \"I didn't say that,\" she retorted. \"Be careful what you try and claim I said! If you put words in my mouth, your fingers will be bitten!\""
    nvl clear
    "The president calmly folded his hands together on the desk before him, sitting up the slightest bit straighter. \"The point, Suzumiya-kun,\" he drawled."
    nvl clear
    "\"Eh, well ... Tsuruya-san discovered this issue and brought it to Kyon. Initially, neither of them even wanted me to know what was going on — and why not?\" She tapped a key on the laptop that was facing away from her, changing to the next slide. \"Would {i}you{/i} want to advertise to everyone in the world that pictures like this were going around, taken in your own school!?\""
    nvl clear
    "For all his stoic demeanor, when presented with the image that Haruhi had chosen for the first example, the student council president could not look away. His expression shifted from coldly arrogant to mildly awed, with tiny hints of concealed mirth. Picking up the laptop and swinging the screen around to Emiri, Haruhi added, \"I would have thought you were too old for character- print underwear, Kimidori-chan. You should come to my club, sometime, though, Kanae-chan is a big fan of Trope-tan, too!\""
    nvl clear
    "The student council secretary's face still bore a serene smile, but Haruhi was positive she saw a flicker of something in her eyes. Something vast and irate. \"I ... see,\" Emiri managed."
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi set the laptop back in front of the president and hit a key for the next screen before he started to enjoy it too much. He'd probably never be able to look at Emiri the same way in any case, but that wasn't her problem. \"This is a list of all of the first year students involved in taking these pictures.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"That....\" The president coughed, looking up from the screen and fixing Haruhi with a dour look. \"I understand the vehemence that such a craven act might instill into someone. But if your entire argument is an appeal to surrenduring to emotions, then you fail completely to understand what a system of law is for.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Okay, fine,\" she retorted, paging to the next slide. \"In that case, let's say that Tsuruya-san brought her complaints to you directly — that someone at the school was somehow taking pictures of her. What would you do?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"That's not entirely a fair question,\" Okabe objected from where he was leaning against a wall. \"Strange as it is that this issue has been handed down to the student council, that sort of action is more than a violation of school policy — it's criminal. If it {i}were{/i} brought to either the student council, or ourselves, then we would defer it to the police! Where it {i}belongs{/i}.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Is that completely true?\" Koizumi wondered aloud, shooting the teacher a questioning glance."
    nvl clear
    "\"Nope!\" Haruhi said brightly. \"In fact, just a few days ago, a student left this school. Ryuguu ... something-or-another. It didn't make the news, no police were involved, and according to the attendance office when I asked, even though this student assaulted Kyon with a knife, he was given the chance to quietly withdraw. Word among students says he was expelled, but the official record says he withdrew for ... no reason whatsoever!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"That's not true,\" Okabe protested."
    "The other teacher winced and shook his head. \"Actually,\" he said, looking away, \"it is.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Is it any question in the face of events like that, or other, interesting 'withdrawals' in the school's past, most coinciding with questionable behavior on the part of a student—\""
    "\"You have evidence to support these allegations?\" the student council president asked, sounding genuinely intrigued."
    nvl clear
    "She nodded, tabbing past a few more example pictures of Emiri until she reached the incident list. \"But, as I was saying,\" she continued, \"is it that surprising that no student trusts the administration enough to come forth? You speak of the law, and order, but where's the justice in a system that sweeps the problem beneath the rug? This school isn't nearly as clean as it wants to claim! How many girls have to endure this humiliation to satisfy this school's pride!?\""
    nvl clear
    "She spread her arms in a helpless gesture, glancing at both teachers, then the student council president. \"And if the police were involved immediately, what would they do? Make the entire thing public first, and then start investigating in their way? Every student and teacher in this school would need to be questioned — in a way, even though he didn't tell me his reasons, Kyon did this school a {i}huge{/i} favor by managing things like this."
    nvl clear
    "\"Now the police only have to question those involved ... and he obtained a signed confession from one of the ringleaders, to say nothing of the other evidence we've amassed! Realistically, this is the smallest amount of publicity you can expect to endure for such an incident....\" Her eyes hardened as she trailed off. \"While still looking out for the interests of the students. Or was {i}this{/i} what your slogan of 'student independence' was supposed to lead to!?\""
    nvl clear
    "The president tilted his head, his glasses shining like mirrors directly into her eyes. She grit her teeth and grinned at him fiercely; she'd never believe it was a coincidence of lighting. He'd obviously watched enough anime to learn to master the effect to conceal his eyes and hide his emotions. That he was hiding behind it now....."
    nvl clear
    "\"What was that,\" he said icily, \"about putting words in the mouths of others?\""
    "\"You're dodging the issue,\" she challenged him."
    nvl clear
    "\"Right, enough, fine,\" Okabe said from the side of the room, his expression sour. \"Suzumiya, if what you're saying is true about incidents being covered in the past to make the school look better, then maybe some small part of why Kyon-kun and the others felt the need to do this themselves is explained. But in any case, it's not right for a student to take matters such as these into their own hands. As has been mentioned before, 'the ends justify the means' is not an acceptable answer, here."
    nvl clear
    "\"Worse, after all is said and done, if we let this pass without reprimand, we send the message to the students that the faculty are incompetent at best, and malicious at worst. We tell every student that the outside world this school is intended to prepare them for is a place where they cannot trust in any strength but their own. I'll even go so far as to say what you suggest would undermine the very society we live in.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Interesting,\" the president remarked, his mouth a flat line, his eyes hidden behind his lenses. Emiri sat in her chair, dutifully recording everything by hand on her notepad. The other teacher sighed and hung his head, obviously worn out by the process."
    nvl clear
    "\"It is interesting,\" Koizumi noted, speaking again for the first time in several minutes, \"to see that the student body in general thinks very highly of Kyon-kun at just this moment. Certainly, almost all of the girls — in any event, a solid fifty percent of the population, at a minimum. Why wouldn't they look up to Kyon, Tsuruya-san, and Nagato as heroes? They alone protected the virtue of upstanding, innocent students by exposing the unfortunate darkness that lurked within our otherwise upstanding school."
    nvl clear
    "\"If they were to be reprimanded, and punished, that would cement their images as martyrs. At least ... if certain documents linking 'withdrawals' to certain unacceptable mischief were to be circulated. Then it would be seen as fact that the school was untrustworthy, going so far to punish any effort to improve the situation and mask what you are correct to say would be perceived as incompetence.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"A...are you ... {i}threatening{/i} the school?\" Okabe asked, his eyes widening in amazement. Haruhi felt a little stunned herself. She'd dug up the evidence for her report, but hadn't considered how useful it genuinely was as leverage ... anyone who was willing could find the same information from the public record."
    nvl clear
    "Still, coming from Koizumi, who she had seen act genuinely forceful exactly one time ... going back to that horrid memory of the only time she'd seen Kyon genuinely angry at {i}her{/i}.... This was a new face for the boy, she thought. His smile had even lessened, becoming thinner, and much more dangerous."
    nvl clear
    "\"Koizumi-kun,\" Okabe warned, shaking his head as he stood upright, no longer leaning against the wall, \"this is very serious—\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I think our answer here is clear,\" the other teacher cut in, suddenly. \"Okabe-sensei, the administration has already passed this decision down to the student council. I believe I see why. Punishing Kyon and the others would make them martyrs in the eyes of the students. Rewarding them would be going too far the other direction. But doing {i}nothing{/i}, and allowing the students to manage themselves, and the authorities to handle the criminal elements...."
    nvl clear
    "\"And, anyway, that all aside, all we're doing here is undermining the authority of the student council we have in place. Letting them handle it allows the student body to see that they're well represented by their own peers.\""
    nvl clear
    "Okabe looked like he was trying to swallow something particularly bitter, but nodded. \"Fine,\" he grumbled. \"Fine.\""
    "\"On that point,\" the teacher continued, glancing at the students, \"we will let you finish this on your own ... but we naturally will need copies of the meeting notes."
    nvl clear
    "Haruhi grinned, crossing her arms over her chest, as the student council president's head lowered, and she caught his resigned expression. She'd already won, as far as she was concerned. Did Kyon feel that same satisfied victorious surge right now, she wondered? He should be happy, knowing he'd solved the problem for good, and she was covering for him where she'd agreed to."
    nvl clear
    "Yeah, she decided, he had to feel as positive as she did right then."
    nvl clear
    
    "After reaching the largely abandoned temple grounds, they'd had enough privacy for Mori to explain things while they slowly strolled around. Tsuruya had listened to Mori's explanation with only occasional questions. In point of fact, when Mori had seemed to veer off and try to explain the roles of the others involved in Haruhi's life, Tsuruya insisted that Mori remain on topic, since she was concerned with the Organization and their involvement with Haruhi specifically. After hearing it all out, she gave a slow nod."
    nvl clear
    "\"So,\" she said, after an extended, thoughtful silence. \"Kyon-kun, was that thing you asked for from aliens, or time travelers?\""
    "\"Aliens,\" he answered. \"As we understand it, anyway. Ironically enough, it was to try and help them learn to slide to alternate dimensions. But that's not really important right now, I think. I mean ... do you believe it?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"I do!\" she agreed, nodding. \"After all, didn't Kyon-kun somehow vanish while we were sleeping together?\""
    "Mori made a pained, choking noise and nearly fell over. \"What!?\" she protested, horrified."
    nvl clear
    "Kyon ignored the woman. Yuki seemed completely unperturbed by the comment, only glancing at Mori with what seemed to be mild curiosity. \"Yeah,\" he agreed. \"Nagato teleported me to her apartment for ... eh ... it was personal.\""
    "Another strangled noise escaped Mori's throat as she stared with something like raw terror at Kyon. \"S...sir,\" she managed, \"you.... Suzumiya....\""
    nvl clear
    "Tsuruya looked thoughtful, but equally indifferent to Mori. \"Okies!\" she decided. \"Let's wrap up that last bit of trouble with the Sumiyoshi-rengo! I can't do it alone, but if I finish this and pass my trial, then maybe I can help Kyon-kun like the others can!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Right,\" he agreed, frowning. \"So, kick in the door to their place and fight how many of them?\""
    "\"Can't be more than twenty,\" Tsuruya said, nodding confidently. \"We should be able to handle them!\""
    "\"Oh, gods,\" Mori moaned, one hand rising to cover her eyes. \"Sir! Do you at least use {i}protection{/i}?\""
    nvl clear
    "\"He has not been given any,\" Yuki answered. \"It has not previously been requested.\""
    "\"Use protection!\" Mori demanded, her voice nearly a screech, her hands balled into fists, her entire body shaking. \"You must! Kyon-ku— That is ... Sir! {i}Please{/i}!\""
    nvl clear
    "Why was she suddenly getting so bent out of shape, he wondered. \"You didn't say anything except that I was on my own the last time I went out to do this with Tsuruya-kun,\" he said, mildly reproachful. \"I had to demand assistance from you that time!\""
    nvl clear
    "\"B...but,\" she protested, wincing. \"I ... I didn't {i}know{/i}!\" She cut herself off suddenly and took a deep, calming breath. After a heartbeat, she recovered her seemingly unshakable demeanor. \"In any case,\" she said evenly, \"I will ensure personally that you are adequately supplied with what you need from this point forward.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"Oh?\" he asked, raising an eyebrow. \"Do you have anything with you?\""
    "Mori's face turned beet red. \"No,\" she said stiffly. \"Of course not. I can— I {i}will{/i} get it for you, rather.\" She put her hand to her face and sighed. \"If you don't mind, Sir, I'll go take care of that now.\""
    nvl clear
    "\"It's fine,\" Tsuruya remarked, nodding. \"I'll call my driver and set things up for our next mission.\""
    "Hands still trembling, Mori quickly hurried away down the stairs to where Arakawa waited in the car."
    nvl clear
    "He turned to look at Yuki. \"Oh,\" he said belatedly, frowning. \"Um, we should get you home.\""
    "Yuki shook her head once, moving a half-step closer to him, but not saying anything."
    nvl clear
    "\"You want to come with us?\" he asked in surprise, while Tsuruya barked a string of orders into her cell phone. Yuki's gaze slowly rose to meet his, and she gave a single sharp nod. He was about to protest when he caught himself. This was Yuki, after all ... and even if she didn't have all her powers and abilities, she had to learn the martial arts he'd learned in order to train him. She outmatched him by several orders of magnitude; why wouldn't he want her help against an unknown yakuza?"
    nvl clear
    "Kyon wished he could shake the feeling of impending doom that seemed to hang over him. What protection was Mori going to get, anyway? Maybe he'd be lucky, and it'd be a bulletproof vest — or better. That was worth hoping for ... but he wasn't likely to get it before the next assignment."
